How are buyers winning in today’s market? This is still possible even with rising interest rates. Can you believe it? We would love to share one story with you that is a great example.&nbsp;

We had a buyer that wanted to sell their house in Newark and come out to Tracy to buy. We were able to negotiate a good sale for them in Newark, which was great\! Then when it came to buying, they were a little worried because of interest rates. Not only did we structure a great deal where we negotiated a little bit below list price, but we were also able to work with the seller to give our buyers a $20,000 credit so they could buy down their rate.&nbsp;

**Having the right team to understand what it takes to win in this market is essential.**&nbsp;

We know a lot about creative financing and have mortgage banking in our background, so we know how to work with lenders to structure deals that will allow buyers to win with a payment that is equal to or below what they were paying in rent. This is a huge advantage. Also, we work with people who have bad credit or never expected they would be able to buy, and show them possibilities they didn’t even think were possible.&nbsp;

If you or anyone you know is in a situation like this, talk to us\! We would love to help you achieve your housing dreams. Reach out by phone call or email anytime.
