How are buyers winning in today’s market? This is still possible even with rising interest rates. Can you believe it? We would love to share a story with you as a great example.&nbsp;

We had a buyer who wanted to sell their house in Newark and come out to Tracy to buy. We were able to negotiate a good sale for them in Newark, which was great\! Then when it came to buying, they were a little worried because of interest rates. Not only did we structure a great deal where we negotiated a little bit below list price, but we were also able to work with the seller to give our buyers a $20,000 credit so they could buy down their rate.&nbsp;

Through creative financing and with mortgage banking in our background, we understand how to work with lenders to structure deals allowing buyers to win with payments equal or below their rental payments. This is a huge advantage. We also help people with bad credit and low buying expectations, showing them they can accomplish what feels impossible.&nbsp;
