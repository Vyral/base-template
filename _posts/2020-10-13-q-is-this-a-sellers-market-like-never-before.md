*The latest Athens stats point to an extremely strong seller’s market.*

What’s the latest news from our real estate market as we make our way through October? **Here are the latest year-over-year stats from Athens and the surrounding area:**

What do these numbers mean? **We’re in a tremendously strong seller’s market.** In my 14 years in the business, I’ve never seen anything like it. I don’t have a crystal ball or know for sure what impact the presidential election will have on the market, but there are a ton of buyers out there now and we’re seeing many multiple-offer situations.

If you’re thinking of selling, don’t hesitate to give me a call. My team and I would be happy to give you a free home valuation. As always, if you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.
