Is now a good time to sell your home or should you wait until after the holidays?

**There are two ways to look at this question.&nbsp;**

If you list now, inventory will be a little lower, so there will be less competition among other sellers. Right after the holidays, there tends to be a surge of sellers who enter the market, which increases the number of homes buyers can choose from. Buyers are also more serious about buying this time of year, so if you pull your home off the market, you might miss out on the opportunity for a quick sale.

If you wait to list until after the holidays, you can enjoy the holiday period without dealing with showings and open houses. Also, as I stated above, more buyers will enter the market after the holidays are over. People assume that spring is the best time to sell a home, but here in Phoenix we don’t really have extreme seasons, so our market is busy every single month.&nbsp;

So, to answer this question, **any month is a great month to list in our market—it just depends on you and your personal situation.&nbsp;**
