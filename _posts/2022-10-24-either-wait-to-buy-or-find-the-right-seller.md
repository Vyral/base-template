Today I’m here to give you a quick tip for buying a home in today's market. Right now, the market is in a state of change: **Interest rates are rising, inventory is increasing, and buyers have a lot more options to choose from.**

With that, there’s a palpable fear within the marketplace. My recommendation for most people, unless you’re relocating across the country, is to wait a little bit to see what the market does. When housing needs arise, they don't always do so in perfect timing with the market cycles. Sometimes you’re forced to make a move when conditions aren’t perfect. However, if you’re in a position where you can hold steady and wait a little while, that might be a good idea for you.&nbsp;

If you do have to buy right now, work with your real estate professional and find a property that's best for your needs and wants. Also, **find a seller who’s willing to be flexible and pay some of your closing costs** so you can buy down your interest rate. That way your monthly payment can be more affordable, and you can get a better home than you could a few months ago.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email or give me a call. I’d love to assist you\!
