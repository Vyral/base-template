What should you consider before moving to Fort Hood and the surrounding areas?&nbsp;

I moved to Fort Hood in 2005, and a couple of things I really thought about before deciding to plant roots in central Texas were affordability and whether this is a good area to raise my family in, with great schools and amenities.

The answer is that **Fort Hood has great amenities and plenty to do\!** Austin is about an hour’s drive away, Dallas is within two and a half hours, and Houston is about three hours away. You can get to many different events, sports, and concerts for a day trip.

Another thing to think about is the outdoors. There are many lakes and hiking trails here. For community events, there are plenty of things going on for families. We have dog parks and a new YMCA. We have a wonderful community that just keeps growing. **Central Texas has developed a lot and has secured a piece of my heart.**

If you have any other questions give me a call or send me an email, I would be happy to help you.
