<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our video blog may be ending, but we aren’t going anywhere.</em></p>

My team and I have an important announcement: Today’s video message will be our last.

Don’t worry, though. We will still be keeping in touch with you in other ways.

This isn’t goodbye—it’s just a new chapter. We hope these messages have brought you value, and that you’ve enjoyed following them as much as we’ve enjoyed making them.

As I said, though, we are still here for you. We look forward to reaching out to you in new ways moving forward.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, we’re only a phone call or email away.
