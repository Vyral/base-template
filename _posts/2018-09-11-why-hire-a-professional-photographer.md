Having professional photos taken is one of the most important things to do when you’re trying to sell your home.

If they’re worth their salt, your agent should notice and utilize the power of professional photography: **90% of homebuyers start their search online, and first impressions are everything when it comes to selling**. Because of this, you’ll need to make sure your home is shown in its best light the first time buyers see it, or you **risk sending them running to a different listing.**

Your photos should have a beautiful presentation: gorgeous colors, lighting, and angles. **Don’t trust that your iPhone can accomplish what professional photographers are paid to do.** Web appeal is the new curb appeal.
