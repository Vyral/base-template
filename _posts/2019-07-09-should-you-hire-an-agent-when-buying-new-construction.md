Victoria Moberly has 10 years’ worth of experience in new home sales, and because of that, I asked her to join me today to explain why **using an agent when buying new construction is more important than you may even realize.** &nbsp;

When she’s on-site at new construction properties, Victoria is repeatedly asked a question that grows out of a common real estate misconception: “**If I don’t hire an agent to represent me, will I receive a better discount?**” The answer to that question is, **unfortunately, no.** Contrary to popular belief, you’ll actually benefit more from having an agent at your side.

**Without representation, you’ll still have to pay a 3% commission fee, but it’ll just go unused, not to mention that you’re hiring the on-site agent to negotiate against you.**

The new construction home buying process is long and painstaking, so **having the support of an agent who has your best interest at heart is paramount to your success**. “As great as the on-site agents are, their job is to represent the seller,” Victoria candidly says.&nbsp;

If an issue were to arise somewhere in the process, you'd be relieved to have an agent or a firm that will hold the builder accountable and push for a remedy on your behalf.&nbsp;

In keeping with our interview with Pam, Victoria also revealed one fun fact about herself. She’s a big fan of movie soundtracks, but since she’s had children, she’s learned that her music tastes are no longer “cool.” The “Frozen” soundtrack is one of her personal favorites.&nbsp;

I thank Victoria for taking some time out of her day to sit down with me and discuss this topic. If you have any questions for us, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We look forward to serving your real estate needs\!
