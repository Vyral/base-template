Dear Clients & Friends,

Did you know that <u>over 14,000 students in Loudoun County don&rsquo;t have enough to eat?</u> They receive food assistance at school during the week, but not on weekends or during school breaks.

On <span class="text-color">May 10th</span>, we will be partnering with a local charity called, <u>Backpack Buddies</u>, to provide meal packs for weekends and holidays for these children who need our help.

This is part of an annual event at Keller Williams called, <span class="text-color">**RED Day****,**</span> where 170,000 Keller Williams associates volunteer in their local communities to give back. Making a difference in the lives of others and bettering the communities that we serve is at the very heart of the Keller Williams culture, and YOU CAN HELP!

#### <span class="text-color">**Here’s how you can help**</span>

* Instant oatmeal
* Granola bars
* Peanut butter/cheese crackers
