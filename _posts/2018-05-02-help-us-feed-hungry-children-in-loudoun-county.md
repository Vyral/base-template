#### **Help us feed children in need in Loudoun County!**

Dear Clients & Friends,

Did you know that <u>over 14,000 students in Loudoun County don&rsquo;t have enough to eat?</u> They receive food assistance at school during the week, but not on weekends or during school breaks.

On May 10th, we will be partnering with a local charity called, <u>Backpack Buddies</u>, to provide meal packs for weekends and holidays for these children who need our help.

This is part of an annual event at Keller Williams called, **RED Day****,** where 170,000 Keller Williams associates volunteer in their local communities to give back. Making a difference in the lives of others and bettering the communities that we serve is at the very heart of the Keller Williams culture, and YOU CAN HELP!

#### **Here’s how you can help**

<br>**1.** **PURCHASE** any of the following non-perishable items.

* Instant oatmeal
* Granola bars
* Peanut butter/cheese crackers
* Applesauce/fruit cups
* Macaroni & cheese
* Canned ravioli/beefaroni/spaghetti (ChefBoyardee)
* Canned Chicken
* Juice boxes
* Shelf-stable milk (Horizon, Organic Valley, etc.)  

**2.** **CALL** (571-338-3880) or **EMAIL** us at DebbieWicker@WickerHomes.com. Our team WILL COME TO YOUR HOME between now and May 10th to pick up these items and deliver them to Backpack Buddies.

#### **Thanks so much for helping us feed children in need!**
