<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The key to unlocking positive customer experiences: strategic communication.</em></p>

What is the No. 1 thing that impacts customer satisfaction? The unequivocal answer is communication. From the moment that you’ve signed a client till the end of their transaction, **the experience that they have—be it good or bad—will be a function of communication**. When it comes to communication, quantity and quality matter equally. It starts with setting appropriate expectations for your client, then carries over to your ability to advise, educate, and guide them. If you fail with your communication (i.e. you don’t provide enough information, or you over-promise and under-perform), customer satisfaction will plummet.&nbsp;

However, if you 1) communicate with every buyer or seller who hires you at a minimum of once per week, and 2) under-promise but over-perform, you’ll drive up customer satisfaction. Here’s how we know that: We’ve been surveying every client on an NPS net promoter score at a deep level for a long time. Time and time again, buyers and sellers alike rank the quantity and quality of communication as the most important measure of their satisfaction. No matter how you slice it, **rock-solid communication is integral to a positive customer experience.&nbsp;**
