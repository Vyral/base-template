Today I want to talk about the importance of home maintenance for first-time buyers. **When you’re ready to take on the responsibility of owning a new home, you also need to be ready to take on the responsibility of the maintenance on your new home.** It’s something you probably wouldn’t think about if you’ve been in an apartment, or a dorm, or living with your parents.

First off, if you negotiate a one-year warranty on your home purchase, that’s awesome. If you don’t have one, you can still get one and I’d be happy to recommend one to you. It’s a good thing to have. **It costs $500 to $600 per year, but it will take care of any major costs for the systems in your home.**

Some common maintenance categories include sidewalks, roof, HVAC, plumbing, gutters, pest control, pool maintenance, and your irrigation system.

**The national stats show that a third of your yearly budget should be set aside for home maintenance.** You might only end up using 1% of your home’s purchase price, but it’s a good idea to always set money aside for worst-case scenarios.&nbsp;

The older your home, the more maintenance you’ll need to budget for. The opposite is true for new homes. However, it’s something you should always be thinking about as a homeowner.

If you have any questions for me or need any recommendations for home warranty companies, service providers, or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
