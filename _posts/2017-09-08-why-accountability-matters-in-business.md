Tracking your numbers and staying accountable is going to make a huge difference in your success. This isn’t something I started seriously myself until this year, but it’s incredibly important.

Recently we’ve been coaching with a Kansas organization that closes over 1,000 transactions and year and ranks number 11 on RealTrends. During our on-site visit in June, something we noticed about all of the people on the team is that everyone tracked their numbers.

Ever since then, this is something my team and I have implemented into our organization as well.

**Every Monday we sit down with our office manager and team leader and report our numbers**. This involves a lot of different measures which are all important to our success.

But it isn’t just once a week that we keep ourselves accountable. We analyze our numbers every single day.

Putting those numbers into data compiled over the course of a week helps our agents figure out where they’re succeeding and where they need growth. For example, last week I got 34 new leads.

Another thing we measure is how quickly we get back in touch with our leads. Typically we try to get back to leads within 30 minutes because communication is super important in growing business. Personally, I achieve this goal with about 70% of my leads.

Better networking means more success; so, another number we pay close attention to is how many calls we’re making and how many appointments our team goes on.

Once that networking translates into deals, we compile that data onto what we call our pending board. We track offers, pending deals, dollar volume, and what those commissions are worth.

Keeping track of these measures allows us to talk about our struggles and how we can improve. **Determining where we need improvements is one of the best ways to better ourselves as a business and as individuals**.

We all help each other to achieve this. If one person is seeing more success in a certain area, they’ll often reach out and assist those who are struggling in that same realm.

Accountability is a huge part of what we do on our team. When people join us, we put together business plans and hold them accountable to their goals. Tracking numbers is a solid way to achieve specific goals.

**Unlike other organizations, our training is free. We’re here to help you develop**.
