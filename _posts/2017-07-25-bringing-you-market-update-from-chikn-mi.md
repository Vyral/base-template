Today we’re at Chik’n Mi restaurant to give you a quick look at our current market.

Now that we’re halfway through the year, Sandie and I are here to bring you a look at what’s going on in today’s local market.

To do this, we’re going inside the new Chik’n Mi restaurant on 2319 Brownsboro Road. This is a great place to eat with a lot to offer. Sandie and I tried a few things, including beignets with a mango miso sauce,  spicy ramen, and even a chicken and bacon sandwich served with roasted potatoes.

The restaurant was created by Jason and Aenith McCullum, who had a dream of bringing great, interesting food to the area. Aenith was born in Laos, a landlocked country in Southeast Asia. She learned traditional recipes from her mother and picked up other culinary influences from other restaurants and also from school.

**“We didn’t create Korean fried chicken,” she said, "but we did create the sauce.”** She and Jason wanted to take what they each knew about food and bring it to the community in a way they knew everyone would love.

Back in the realm of real estate, interest rates right now are holding steady. Home sales are down 12.8% for the month of June year over year. Last year was better in this area, but not because people aren’t looking for or can’t afford homes.

Our prediction is that the market will stay in good shape as long as there are homes coming onto it. Homes in the $100,000 and about $400,000 are selling quickly as long as they’re in good conditions and in the right location.

If moving up is in your future, **there are great deals right now within the $500,000 to $800,000 price range—which is a buyer's market.** These homes are sitting a little longer, so now is a great opportunity for anyone looking for their next property in that range.

So if we can help you with any of your real estate needs be sure to check us out. Also, be sure to check out Chik’n Mi at 2319 Brownsboro Road.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
