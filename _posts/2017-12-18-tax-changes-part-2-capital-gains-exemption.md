Some big tax changes have recently been proposed in Washington.

A couple of these changes are going to impact the real estate market in a fairly significant way. Last time, we talked about the mortgage interest tax deduction.

This time, I’d like to go over changes relating to capital gains exemption. To put it simply, **capital gains refers to the profit you make when you sell a home for more than you bought it.**

Currently, capital gains exemption law states that if you’ve lived in your home for two of the last five years, you can don’t have to claim your gains as income. Currently the cap for this is $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a married couple.

If these tax changes go through, you will need to have lived in your home for five of the last eight years in order to be exempt from capital gains tax. **This change could have a big impact on our market.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
