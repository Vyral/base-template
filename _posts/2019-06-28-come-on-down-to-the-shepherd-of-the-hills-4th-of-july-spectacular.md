<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you don’t have plans this Fourth of July, I have a family-friendly celebration you might be interested in.</em></p>

If you’re looking for something fun to do with your family this Fourth of July, **the Shepherd of the Hills church here in Porter Ranch is holding their 21st annual 4th of July Spectacular**, and I’m inviting you to come on down and join the festivities.&nbsp;

Their 21-minute fireworks finale after sundown is the main event, but there are plenty of fun activities taking place beforehand that both kids and adults can enjoy, including:

* Face painting
* Sprinkler zones&nbsp;
* A youth cadet parade from the LAPD and the LAFD
* A flyover conducted by vintage World War II aircrafts

The gates open at 4:30 p.m., and some of the city’s favorite food vendors will be waiting for you, but you’re welcome to bring your own cooler of food and drinks if you so desire. Just keep in mind that all bags and containers will be inspected before entry.&nbsp;
