You might be surprised to find out that in the Fredericksburg-Stafford, Virginia area, there are 148 foreclosed homes and over 320 homes in pre-foreclosure on the market.

Also, about 2,200 families’ homes mortgages are 60 to 90 days late. This is especially startling since we’re following a fairly nice market run up from the last crash we had in 2010 or 2011.

Even still, 15% to 20% of homes in our local market are worth less than the amount owed on the mortgages.

I’ve personally worked with and helped hundreds of people across Northern Virginia to overcome situations just these kind of situations. These people needed to sell, but owed more than their homes were currently worth.

This kind of circumstance is called a short sale.
