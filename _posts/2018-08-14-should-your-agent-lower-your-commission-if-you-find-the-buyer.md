Today we want to talk to you about whether or not your real estate agent will take a lower commission if you find your own buyer. **It’s a common misconception that landing your own buyer means you’re off the hook for paying your agent’s commission.**

Of course, the goal of selling a home is finding someone to buy it. However, the work isn’t over once a buyer is located. A lot goes into finalizing the sale, most of which is facilitated by the agent. If you’ve signed a contract with an agent that outlines the terms of the payment, there’s a good chance that you will be held to the amount, even if you’re the one who finds the buyer. **You can ask your agent to reduce the commission, but they aren’t obligated to do so.**

Real estate agents do a lot to earn their keep from home sellers. Finding a buyer is only one of their many responsibilities. After an offer is accepted, the agent has a lot of work to do behind the scenes, including working with the buyer’s agent and/or lawyer. All of this effort takes time.&nbsp;

Before signing an agreement with an agent, you do have the opportunity to discuss the finer points of the agreement with them. If you're set on paying a lower commission if you find your own buyer, make sure it’s outlined in your listing agreement.&nbsp;

**As with everything in life, you get what you pay for.** A typical real estate commission is 5% to 6% of the home’s sale price, with about 3% of that going to your agent.
