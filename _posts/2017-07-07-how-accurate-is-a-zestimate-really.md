excerpt: The Zestimate can be useful as a place to start but it isn’t the same thing as an appraisal.

In this weekly webinar, I’d like to talk to you about Zillow. You may have heard recently that **a woman in the Chicago area is suing them.**&nbsp;

She’s claiming that consumers are using the Zestimate on her property as an appraised value of her home, which she has priced at $638,000 compared to the $562,000 value that Zillow gave it.&nbsp;

A $64,000 difference is obviously a big deal. And because so many people use Zillow as a tool, she is claiming that the Zestimate actually caused her to sell her home below value.&nbsp;

In fact, by Zillow’s own statement **they admit that the Zestimate is off by an average of 5%. Depending on the price point, this can really add up.**&nbsp;

I do want to stress that Zillow is an easy and user-friendly tool, but it is only a starting point.

If you’re a buyer or seller and really want to zone in on a home’s true value, you should do one of two things.&nbsp;

First, you could go to a real estate professional for a competitive market analysis. This will be a lot more accurate and fine-tuned than a Zestimate.

But if you’re willing to spend $400 or $500 you could also use the second option, which is to order a formal appraisal for your property.&nbsp;
