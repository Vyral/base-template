In a previous video, we talked about what was happening in the real estate business and how we were adapting to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, we’ve seen inventory levels and showing traffic drop off. Make no mistake though, there are still serious buyers out there right now, but an increasing number of them are utilizing virtual showings. Interest rates remain low, so demand from buyers is still there.
