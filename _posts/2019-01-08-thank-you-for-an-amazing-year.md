2018 was an amazing year for us here at Woodlands Eco Realty, and we have all of you to thank. **We are so grateful for the incredible number of you who trusted your buying and selling goals with us throughout the year.**

I wanted to take a moment to reflect on all of the generosity that fills my life and thank clients and friends like you for your help and support that you provide so that I can follow my passion of helping special needs and elderly animals at Pure Mutts Animal Sanctuary. Please accept my gratitude from the bottom of my hear for joining me on this journey. **Every time you buy or sell a home with us, every time you refer someone to us who buys or sells a home with us, you help us save more lives.** You show up when I need help, you celebrate with me during my milestones, and you show me love and compassion after I lose a dog. You donate personally, you ask your employers to match donation and you share our please with your family and friends. Many of you have us as your Amazon Smile charity, so every time you shop we get a donation from Amazon. Small things make a big impact. All of you are not only my clients, but my friends, my supporters, and my cheerleaders.

**2018 has been incredibly good at some fronts, and sad at others.** I lost five dogs at the sanctuary. We rescued 9 new ones. It's a never-ending struggle. We have a new puppy who is fighting for his life that the vet right now. Only three months old, he was thrown out like trash. After spending two weeks alone in the cold, he came down with parvo. Please pray that he makes it! He's still hanging around, and each day he lives is a miracle.

We started the year with a continuation of cleanup from Harvey, helping flooded homeowners sell their homes as-is. We are happy to report that we were able to get 25% more than what our homeowners were getting offered by investors. Overall, we saved our buyers $263,000 in total, by negotiating lower prices. **We helped our sellers earn an additional $217,000 in total, outside of their expectations. Most listings sold in the first few days, many with multiple offers.**

In March, we opened Acorn Manor Assisted Living facility, where elderly people can come live with their pets. 2018 was an amazing year for us here at Woodlands Eco Realty When I came up with the idea last year, I did not have a clue what it takes to open an assisted living facility, but here we are! We even had our first resident hospice dog, Serena. It's heartbreaking that Serena was only able to enjoy a few months with us before passing away. Now we have a new elderly dog who has spent her life on the streets and suffers from arthritis.

We've received many awards this year, two of which being the Spectrum Award for Excellence in Customer Service, and the Broker Adviser Certificate of Excellence for both company and individual agent. All of these awards are rewarded based on client review and testimonials, so thank you for making us look good! I was honored to be selected as one of the 2018 influential women by Review It Magazine, 2018 Who is Who by Houston Agent's Magazine, and the National Association of Realtors Good Neighbor Grant winner. I had a great opportunity to be a part of the Texas Realtor's Leadership Program and get certified as a community emergency response team member of Montgomery County. **It's been a whirlwind year!**

To celebrate all of these wins and this amazing year we threw a client appreciation party and also raised funds for North Carolina's flood victims with a Dog's Day movie at the new X-Scape Theater. &nbsp;Despite the poor weather, many of you made it! We missed the others that could not attend. Due to this event, we were able to take 5,000 pounds of dog food to North Carolina.

We also collected 72 pounds of candy to send to the troops at Halloween. Thank you for dropping off all of that candy! Our last event of the year was our Santa Paws event and a lot of you brought your pets for picture and donated to California's fire victims. **I will be doing this event next year, and hopefully will get to see more of you with your fur babies!**

Some media outlets picked up on our story and it has been published a few times.

Whoever is responsible for this, **thank you for getting the word out about our mission!**

Without your business, your friendship, and your continued support, none of what we do would be possible. **So, from the bottom of our hearts: Thank you.** Letâ€™s make 2019 another amazing year. To see a few of our teams favorite moments from 2018, watch this short video.
