  themselves when it comes to interest rates. Here is when the appropriate time
  to do that is.

  Be wary of deceptive online lenders that will advertise a rate that is too

I just wanted to chat with you for a quick minute and talk to you a little bit about a trend that I have been noticing. **With interest rates going up, it seems that buyers are a bit more scrutinizing of lending costs, rates, fees, and so forth.**&nbsp;

While I do not think that it is a bad thing to make sure that you understand what you are being charged, at the same time, once you have a home under contract and you are past the due diligence and appraisal periods, **that is not the time to start shopping for a new lender.** The time to do that research is before you buy a home. Get a couple of rate and fee quotes before you start looking around and making a decision.

I do not want you to feel like you canâ€™t test the market and shop around, because you can. However, **there are so many deceptive online lenders out there that do not care about deadlines and put so many buyers in such awful positions** that end up costing them thousands of dollars. I do not want that to happen to you, so heed my advice.

We are always here to look out for your best interests. If you have any questions about when and how you should shop around for rates or about anything else related to real estate, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
