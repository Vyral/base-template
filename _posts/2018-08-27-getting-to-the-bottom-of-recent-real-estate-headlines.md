There’s been some bad news reported on our real estate market recently.

Articles about sellers slashing their asking prices and about rapidly expanding inventory are all over the place, but do such headlines truly spell trouble for our market? Do these recent trends mean prices are about to drop?

We don’t know.

What we do know is what happened the last time we went through a challenging real estate market. **T****o get a better idea of what might be happening in the near future, let’s take a look at how real estate fared back then**.

North Texas home prices hit their all-time low in January of 2009, when the median sales price across the entire MLS was just $127,950. Then, between January of 2009 and April of 2011, inventory made a huge leap, leaving our market with 8.6 months’ worth of supply. For comparison, the inventory levels today tend to sit between two-and-a-half to three months.

**With such a massive increase in supply over the two years between 2009 and 2011, many would assume that a drop in prices ensued**. However, this is not what happened. In fact, prices actually increased by about 10% over that time.

How did this happen? Well, certain sellers during that time understood what it took to be successful, while others simply watched their property sit on the market.
