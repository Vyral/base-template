<br>I have been in the real estate business for a very long time, and no matter what is happening in the market, many agents come and go constantly. What’s sad about this is that those **Realtors have put time, energy, money, and often their love into developing and nurturing tons of relationships**.

When agents leave the business for any reason, their clients are just left there, without a real estate agent to help them. I believe all real state agents should think like the businessperson they are and ensure that their clients are taken care of in the future. They should have a plan. That’s what the Golden Handoff is.

The Golden Handoff is entrusting a database to another agent and receiving a referral fee in return. That new real estate agent will have a plan and stay in touch with these clients. How smart and simple is that? This doesn’t cost the departing agent any time, energy, or money.
