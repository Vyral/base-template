Should you have an open house or not? **We are huge fans of open houses.** The open house is an integral part of our marketing system in order to help you get top dollar for your home. Having an open house creates energy and gives buyers the opportunity to see your home.

Think about it: let’s say someone is shopping online for a three-bedroom, two-bath home with a two-car garage, but you only have a one-car garage. The online buyer wouldn’t see your home. Open houses only increase your chances for selling your home at top dollar. Three reasons:

1. **People may miss your home** if it doesn’t have every detail you think you want. Again, if they’re thinking they want a two-car garage, they may change their mind when they see your house in person.

2. **Consider general foot traffic.** Someone who walks into your open house is probably someone who didn’t know about your home previously.

3. **More buyers coming in increases the overall interest in your home. **

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
