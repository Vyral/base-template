Here are the four things you need to do to successfully buy a home in 2021:

**1\. Understand the market.** Right now, our market is being driven by a severe shortage of inventory, very high demand, and low interest rates. This is creating the strongest seller’s market we’ve ever seen. The home you want to buy is also likely the favorite home of multiple other buyers, so be prepared to compete.

**2\. Make your offer as strong as possible.** You need to have a pre-approval lined up, as well as funds set aside for your down payment and closing costs.&nbsp;

**3\. This doesn’t have to be your forever home.** Rather, it could be a stepping stone to get you to your forever home.

**4\. We’ll remain in this strong seller’s market for a while.** Based on the data, these conditions will continue for quite some time. Taking action now could get you into a place that could ultimately lead to your forever home.

If you have any questions at all about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
