There are a few steps sellers should take to get their homes ready for listing photos.

 First of all, organize and clean the home so it looks spacious and inviting to buyers. You don’t want the home to look sparse, but you do need to declutter. Get everything off the countertops. You can maybe leave a decorative, colorful cannister out, but put the coffeepot and the toaster away.

 Now, you don’t necessarily need to have everything hidden away for home showings, but it does have to be like that for the photos. No one likes a photo of themselves, even though it’s a picture of the same person you saw in the mirror this morning. **Photos are still, which gives you a chance to examine every detail you don’t like. The same holds true for photos of your home on the MLS.**

 So, get everything off the top of the fridge, make a nice arrangement on the table, and make sure everything is in its place. If you have to move a bunch of stuff into a separate room to take the photos, go ahead. You can just move everything back later.

Finally, make sure you take photos when the sun is on the front of your house and there are no shadows. Shadows can make a home look sad and dismal. You should also make sure that the front yard looks nice; put down fresh mulch and seal the driveway. Then, your listing photos will be in great shape.

 If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
