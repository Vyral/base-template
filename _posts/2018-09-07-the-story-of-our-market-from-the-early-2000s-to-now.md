To understand the state of our current market, it’s time to look back on how we got here in the first place. 

As you know, **we had a huge increase in prices in the late 90s/early 2000s, and this increase peaked in 2006.** In Anne Arundel County, the median home price back then was $344,000. As you know, the market then crashed and reached its bottom around 2011. At that point, the median home price in our area had dropped to $280,000. As of this month, it’s jumped back up to $340,000. As you can see, we haven’t come all the way back, but we’re almost there.

During most of that same time frame (2005 to 2016), the average household income increased 3.6%, which is pretty flat. While housing prices went up and down, the current average is up 4.62% compared to where it was at in 2005.

**Between 2002 and 2006, the median sale price increased 82%.** It’s hard to believe they increased that much over four years, but they did. Then from 2006 to 2011, the median sale price decreased 18.6%—a number which sounds like a big drop until you consider how far they rose before that. That $280,000 median sale price we saw in 2011, when the market bottomed out, was still 48% higher than what we saw in 2002, 26% higher than what we saw in 2003, and 3.7% higher than in 2004. 

We saw a lot of price gyration in that time, but **since 2011, our market has steadily recovered and prices have gradually increased.** As it stands now, it’s a great time to both buy and sell if you want to make a move.
