In the spirit of helping you achieve your own greatness and potential as an agent, today’s tip is on creating the perfect real estate schedule for yourself.

**First, as you get your morning underway, make “I am” statements part of your routine.** This could be anything from “I am successful” to “I am a powerful negotiator.” See, your brain operates like a CPU and expands upon what you’ve already programmed into it.

Further, **emotional highs and lows can take root and stand in the way of your success when you don’t have a clear design to your day.** Think about it in these terms: If you have 24 hours to plan for an upcoming trip and make sure you leave no loose ends in your life and business, you’ll create a list, pack, make all your calls, and check off all the boxes on your to-do list before you leave. In the same way, this is how your day-to-day schedule should be.

**Start your day off on the right foot and design your schedule in advance because, let’s face it, if it’s not in your schedule, it doesn’t exist.** Prioritize what matters most by scheduling it first, and plot out a timetable for when you’ll practice scripts, generate leads, and follow up with leads.

**Organize follow-up calls by crafting specific scripts.** For example, use one script when reaching out to, say, 10 sphere of influence contacts and another script for follow-up with contacts established from the prior weekend’s open houses.

Some other early-morning scheduling tactics include journaling with a focus on daily goals, getting to the gym bright and early, and engaging in meditation or prayer after or before your trip to the gym. Then, cap it all off with a nutritious breakfast.

Get to the office between 8:15 and 8:30 and set aside about 30 minutes to run through scripts using a colleague as your partner. From there, **jump on the phones and aim to land 25 new contacts over a two- to three-hour period.**   

When you have a few free moments with no calls or appointments booked, use that extra time to work on and enrich your individual business.
