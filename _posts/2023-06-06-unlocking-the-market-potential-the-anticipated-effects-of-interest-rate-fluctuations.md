Today, we will address a common question: "How's the market?" The current real estate market is experiencing a unique dynamic that hasn't been seen in the past 15 yearsâ€”low inventory. This scarcity of available properties has implications for homeowners who wish to sell and move into something different.

Many homeowners who purchased their homes in the past, whether it was a long time ago or recently, took advantage of historically low interest rates by refinancing. This allowed them to reduce their mortgage payments and enjoy the benefits of a low rate. Now, some of these homeowners are looking to upgrade their living situation, such as moving to a larger home or a different school district. However, a significant challenge arises when they consider selling their current property.

**The dilemma they face is that by selling, they would be giving up their lower interest rate and affordable monthly payment.** In the current market, mortgage rates are in the sixes, significantly higher than what they currently enjoy. Consequently, many homeowners are hesitant to make the move and are finding ways to adapt and make do with their current situation, patiently waiting for rates to decrease.

The question then becomes: At what point will interest rates drop enough to motivate people to endure the higher rates and make the leap to a different property? Recent studies indicate that the "magic number" in people's subconscious minds, where the perceived pain of a higher rate becomes more tolerable, is around 5.5%.

Based on this insight, we anticipate that when interest rates reach or approach the 5.5% mark, the floodgates will open. **Homeowners will be more willing to list their current homes for sale and actively search for replacement properties.** This surge in activity is expected to free up inventory and result in more options for prospective buyers.

The state of the market, particularly concerning inventory, is influenced by the delicate balance between interest rates and homeowner decisions. If rates drop to around five and a half percent, we can anticipate a significant increase in inventory as more homeowners unlock their current homes and pursue new opportunities. This insight provides valuable context for understanding the current market conditions and how they may evolve.
