If you’re thinking about buying a property and turning it into a vacation rental, what do you need to do to make sure it pays off?&nbsp;

First, **you need to ask yourself what your goals are.** It is very important to be clear about what you want to accomplish because, after all, this is a major investment. For example, you may want to use this property for about one month a year plus several weekends and have some help in covering annual costs. Or perhaps you want a full-out rental property to maximize income.&nbsp;

In any case, you want to add up those costs—your fixed costs and your variable costs. Whether you want to hire a rental agent or do it yourself depends on you, but many vacation rental owners are not on call 24/7 and require the assistance of a professional rental property manager to maximize income and manage costs.&nbsp;

When all is said and done, **owning your own vacation home and renting it out can be a rewarding experience or a disappointing one depending upon your expectations.&nbsp;**

Our office manages the largest inventory of rentals here on the Crystal Coast, and we can assist you in locating the right property and helping prepare a budget forecast of the rental income and all the costs plus the potential appreciation. This forecast will give you a complete picture of the potential for your investment.&nbsp;
