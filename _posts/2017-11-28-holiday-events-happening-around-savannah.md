  With the holiday season upon us, many of us are busy planning our activity
  schedule. With that in mind, today I’m taking a break from real estate to
  share a few upcoming events in the Savannah area. I myself have participated
  in these events, and they’re always a great time. First is the Christmas on
  the River celebration happening in downtown Savannah from December 1 to
  December 3. To learn about more fun holiday activities happening soon in our
  area, watch my latest video.
