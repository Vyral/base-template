Summertime is here, which means it’s an active buying season in our industry and inventory is tight in the marketplace. Here are a few tips to help guide your buyers through this highly competitive market:

**1. Make sure your buyer is pre-approved if they won’t be paying in cash.** Also, make sure they’re pre-approved with a local lender. Sellers today are very savvy, and they won’t necessarily view an approval from an out-of-state lender as desirable as a local lender with a track record of being able to close loans in that neighborhood. Counsel your buyers that this step is necessary before they even begin to look at properties.

**2. Talk to them about their responsiveness.** If it’s a couple, will they both be available to respond to and sign documents in short order? It’s likely you will have a tight time frame dictated by the seller, so you need to be able to respond quickly.

**3. Coach your buyer about the reality of multiple offers.** If they’re making an offer on a property in a high-demand neighborhood, it’s very likely they’ll have to deal with multiple offers. Before you show them any properties, familiarize them with the “Seller’s Notice to Buyers of Multiple Offers” form and the addendum you’ll have to add to the purchase contract. Show them hard copies of these forms so they can read through them and understand what’s expected of them.

**4. Make sure your buyer is aware of the escalation clause.** This isn’t an approved form by the division of real estate, but it’s particularly useful for clients who might be traveling who want to put their highest, best offer out there as a percentage over any other price that might come forward. If you do use this clause, though, make sure you’re heeding the advice of an attorney or the blessing of your principal broker. If used properly, this tool can be really helpful in a highly competitive market.
