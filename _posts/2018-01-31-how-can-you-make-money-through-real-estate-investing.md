Real estate investing continues to be a tried and true, solid and safe wealth builder, and there are three profit centers real estate investors can take advantage of to make money: **use change, cash flow, and appreciation.&nbsp;**

Use change comes from fixing and flipping. Cash flow comes from holding the property in the short term and enjoying the passive rental income on a month-to-month basis. Appreciation comes from buying the property, fixing it up, renting it, holding it for a while, and enjoying the appreciation over time.&nbsp;

There aren’t a lot of fix-and-flip opportunities out there, and what’s making the prospect of a fix-and-flip so attractive is the fact that the rental market is down. We don’t have enough inventory, and people are dying to buy a rental property. If you do that, fix that property up so it’s reasonably inhabitable, and rent it out, it should produce a nice cash flow. Our properties are appreciating 6% year over year.&nbsp;

If you put those three profit centers together, you got a triple play—you’ll get the gains from the improvement in the value, the passive rental income on a month-to-month basis, and the appreciation over a yearly basis.&nbsp;

If you’re not ready to move to Florida or move into a bigger house in Florida, **buying a rental property now at today’s prices, holding it, and letting it appreciate is a great option**.&nbsp;
