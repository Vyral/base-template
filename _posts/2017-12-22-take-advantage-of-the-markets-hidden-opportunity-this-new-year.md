*With 2018 just around the corner, I’d like to let you know about an exciting opportunity.*

The new year is just around the corner, and if you’re thinking of making a move in the near future, there’s an opportunity available to you.

This opportunity is one I think most people don’t know about. **January 1 has the lowest inventory of the year.** After that, inventory will build over the next several months.

Within the first 60 to 90 days of the year, a lot of serious buyers are active in the market. In other words, right now is an excellent time to sell.

There are currently about 650 homes on the market, which isn’t much at all.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Whatever your real estate needs, my team and I would like to help you out. **Thank you for a great 2017. Happy New Year!**
