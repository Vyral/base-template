We are focused on keeping you informed during this shifting real estate market so you have all the knowledge to make good decisions when it comes to your own home selling, buying, and investing goals. Today we want to talk about Utah’s real estate market since Governor Herbert declared a State of Emergency in March.

Since the State of Emergency was announced, 3983 new homes came on the market, an incredible 4708 homes went into under contract status, and 4711 houses closed.&nbsp;

This means that buyers are still buying and buying at a higher rate than homes are coming available.

**What does this mean for sellers?**

* Should you wait to sell?
  * It appears a lot of sellers are waiting for the dust to settle.&nbsp; Last year there were nearly 4000 homes sold during the same 30 day time period starting from March 6th, 2019.&nbsp;
  * We are short about 750 sellers who would normally put their home on the market during this time period.&nbsp;
* Is this the best possible pricing for a seller in this market.
  * If you have less competition, you have less time on the market and more upward pressure on pricing from buyers looking to buy.&nbsp; With the Stern Team’s Strategic Listing System we are generating multiple offers on our new listings in the past 30 days about 78% of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  * We realize that not every seller feels comfortable having their home on the market during this time period. For those who need to sell, we’ve created a Safe Seller System.

**What does this mean for buyers?**

* Historic low-interest rates make this a great time to take advantage of buying.&nbsp;
  * Interest rates are currently at 60-year lows. The federal and state governments are doing all they can to ensure the American Dream stays afloat.&nbsp; The bottleneck that temporarily jacked up the interest rates has subsided and rates are back to all-time lows.&nbsp;
* Interest rates move up 1% while housing costs go up by 10%.
  * Buyers have been super savvy.&nbsp; They’re educated on how interest rates affect their cost of homeownership.&nbsp; Buyers know that if interest rates go up by 1% which we saw for nearly a week late last month, their mortgage payment will go up by 10%. Another way of looking at that is if the home you’re buying is $300,000 and interest rates go up by 1% that same house will now have a&nbsp; payment as if you’d spent $330,000 on that home.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  * Values are still seemingly going up, judging by the rate buyers are buying versus the rate sellers are putting their homes on the market. So another good question to ask is, “Do you think that $300,000 will be worth 10% less or $270,000 before interest rates go up by 1%.?”&nbsp;
* 44 year average on interest rates for 30-year mortgages 8.4%. We are nearly 5% lower than that right now.&nbsp; There’s a lot of room for interest rates to go up and we certainly hope they do not, but getting used to interest rates below 4% would be a mistake.&nbsp;
* Some home buyers are not wanting to go out and look at homes right now, yet they still want to buy. We’ve put together a Virtual Home Buying program that many of our buyers are taking advantage of.
