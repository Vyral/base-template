Today I wanted to take some time to talk to you about some things you should consider before buying a property governed by a homeowners association.

 If you want to make sure you and your property are protected during a move, here are five essential tips you should follow.

 First, do your research. Don’t just look in the phone book for the cheapest person. Look into Yelp, Facebook, and other similar online sites for reviews on movers. When you see one you like, ask for a referral from someone who used them. You don’t want to hire a person who’s never done this before—there are plenty of real estate horror stories that started that way.

 Second, verify your mover is licensed, insured, and meets any and all federal requirements to travel for your move—especially if you’re traveling via interstate. If you are traveling via interstate, stick to one of the national mover companies like Atlas or Mayflower or at least a local company that’s affiliated with these national movers.

 Third, watch out for the lowball bid. I’ve seen many instances of movers giving a person an extremely low bid, only to up their prices once the move starts. If something seems too good to be true, it typically is.

Fourth, have a contingency plan. I always tell people to move out the day before their closing happens. That way if something unplanned happens, like the truck not showing up on time or not showing up at all, you have a day to deal with it. Get out the day before, put your belongings in storage overnight, and relieve some stress knowing that everything is taken care of and ahead of schedule.

 Lastly, protect yourself. If your mover offers insurance packages that help protect your information, pay a little extra for it. This will give you peace of mind that your stuff is protected. Whether it’s a short-distance move or a long-distance move, it’s smart to pay to have your stuff protected and you’ll be glad you did it.

 If you have any questions about how to protect yourself during your move or any other real estate topics you can think of, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help.
