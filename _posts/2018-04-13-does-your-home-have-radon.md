**Radon is an odorless, tasteless, and invisible radioactive gas** that occurs naturally in rocks and soils underneath your home. It will accumulate in your house if it goes undetected and can be very dangerous. In fact, it’s the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States and kills about 20,000 people a year.

**You can test for radon gas in your home by using simple kits** that are available at your local hardware stores. There are long-term tests as well as short-term tests if you need them done quickly.

For the sale of a home, I recommend the long-term test. It will make sure that you get a very accurate reading and allow you to protect your family.

If you have radon present in your home, **the EPA recommends that you mitigate the levels if they’re over 4 picocuries per liter.** There are several types of mitigation systems available that you can get from local contractors.

For more information about radon, testing, or mitigation, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
