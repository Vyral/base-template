Real estate is one of my passions in life, but it’s not my only one. When I started, it was just supposed to be temporary. But 10 years later, this is the best thing that could have happened to me. It has allowed me to take my passion for my business and use that to enrich the other passions in my life. Thanks to all of your support, I’ve been able to help so many different, wonderful dogs.

**In fact, my Pure Mutts Animal Sanctuary was recently featured on ABC 13 News, which you can see in full [here. ](https://abc13.com/community-events/woodlands-woman-finds-her-calling-caring-for-sick-dogs-/5160490/?fbclid=IwAR2Q7h_zVfJt9_B5m55YjqZt1ZU5vsRAMHFUsJ-RZNccGyH-eYk_uMF9uKg)**

For two years, I looked for a place to start the sanctuary, and my original idea was to have 10 acres. It was never about how many dogs I could rescue—**i****t was about the quality of life I could give them.**

I didn’t start this to make a difference. I started it because that’s where my heart is and I knew there was a need. I think this is what I was born to do.

If you have any questions for me about either of these passions, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m always here to help and answer any questions you may have.
