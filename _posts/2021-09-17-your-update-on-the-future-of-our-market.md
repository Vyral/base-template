As we head into fall, I want to give you a quick update on our real estate market and where I expect it to go this season. The rainy weather might be putting homes literally underwater, but I predict our market to do the opposite.

The Federal Reserve continues to print money, and interest rates remain low. Because of these factors, **I expect inflation to continue to rise and iBuyers to continue to be prevalent**. I’ll be putting together two reports on the impact this has on our market so that you have a better understanding of how to navigate the changes.

**As far as our general market, things are slowing down a little bit**, but this is mostly due to record-high rates of Americans taking vacations this year. I personally took some time off this year, and I hope you were able to as well. However, I expect this vacation rush to slow down, and it looks like the online data is supporting my prediction.

In the future, I won’t be emailing every video. Instead, I’ll upload some exclusively to my Youtube page, so **if you don’t want to miss out, make sure you [<u>subscribe to my channel</u>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt_ZwcvRpX9g4CKKwSBKlKA){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** and like, comment, and share this video.

Hopefully, you understand our market heading in to fall a little better. If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything else, please reach out to me via phone or email. I am always willing to help.
