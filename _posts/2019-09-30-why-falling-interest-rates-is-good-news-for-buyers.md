<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Interest rates are falling, which means now is a great time to buy.</em></p>

Falling interest rates is a trend that sounds wonderful, but what does this really mean for you? Does it make that big of a difference if you’re a homebuyer? **Actually, yes.&nbsp;**

Interest rates are under 4% right now. Back in January of this year, they were hovering between 4.5% to 4.75%. This means you can currently buy a house worth $360,000 to $370,000 for the same exact mortgage payment that would’ve only gotten you a $300,000 house back in January.

Alternatively, if you were thinking of buying in the $250,000 to $300,000 price range back in January, your mortgage payment would be lower if you bought a house now in that same price range. You can also shorten your mortgage repayment period to 20 years and it wouldn’t make that much of a difference between what you would’ve paid in January.&nbsp;

In other words, **it’s a great time to buy, and we have a great selection of homes in our market that I’d love to show you.** If you’d like to start your home buying journey or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
