Homebuyer confidence is higher than ever, and long-term renters are looking to start buying. Today I’ll talk about why that is.

Why are homebuyers suddenly so optimistic? Right now, homebuyer confidence is at an all-time high, and there is an increasing number of renters who think that now is a good time to buy.

There are three reasons that I believe explain this phenomenon:

**1. Lending guidelines are loosening up.** Back in 2010 and 2011, things were a little bit harder on the buyer side to qualify for a mortgage. Now that the guidelines have opened up a bit, it has enabled more buyers to buy a home.

**2. Jobs are looking good.** Fewer buyers are concerned about losing their jobs. Additionally, the median household income is now 150% of what their monthly payment would be as opposed to the historical average of 125%.

**3. Long-term renters are now opting to buy homes.** Millennials, the generation born after 1980, have mostly opted out of homeownership up until now. Now that they’re entering the market as first-time buyers, they’re further along in their careers with higher income and more savings.

So what does all this mean for you? If you’re on the fence about buying a home, those are three things to take into consideration. It’s definitely still a good time to buy, and interest rates are low compared to historic averages.
