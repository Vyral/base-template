Lots of people have been asking me lately about whether it’s a good idea to add solar panels to their home.

The answer really depends on how long you plan on living there. **If you plan on being in a home for a very long time, adding solar panels is probably a great idea.**

However, if you aren’t going to be in your current home for very much time at all, you may want to wait until you’re settled somewhere else.

I personally think solar panels are great. It’s wonderful to be self-reliant. The challenge, though, is that when it comes to selling a home, **solar panels are not always appraised for their full value.**

Additionally, not all buyers will want solar panels. Sometimes, they’ll even request for them to be removed before they close.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
