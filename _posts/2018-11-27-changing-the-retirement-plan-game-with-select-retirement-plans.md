<br>There have always been challenges when managing a 401(k) or 403(b) plan for any company. The sheer amount of administrative tasks, employee notifications, benchmarking requirements, and just the overall time and resources can be overwhelming. There’s also significant personal and corporate liability that your company faces.

However, I’m happy to say that I have a solution to make offering a retirement plan so much easier.

**The solution?**

We’ve created the Select Family of Retirement plans, which are designed to minimize the workload and the liability associated with offering a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. By reducing the administrative burdens, we allow you to focus on improving employee savings and investment behaviors through a robust education campaign, which can help them improve their retirement.

Employers who choose to adopt one of this program's plans pool their retirement plan assets together into what is known as an open Multiple Employer Plan (MEP). In this structure, we greatly streamline the plan oversight and administrative process.

Before, to have similar benefits, employees had to be a part of an industry association. Now, however, we can make this available to any employer with over $2 million in assets.

**So why choose the Select Retirement Plans program?**

It has many benefits, but employers are most thrilled with being able to outsource the vast majority of administrative tasks and fiduciary liability. The program eliminates the costly staff hours associated with investment meetings and the associated liability, while still allowing you to control all your plan design provisions. We also offer seamless payroll integration and full fee transparency.
