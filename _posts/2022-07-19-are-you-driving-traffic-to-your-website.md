Recently, we’ve been doing a series on “Shift” by Gary Keller. This book is full of tactics you can use to thrive in a changing market. If you need a copy of the book, just reach out to us; we’d be happy to send you a copy. Today we’re covering shift tactic No. 6, which is all about converting internet leads.&nbsp;

**Converting internet leads comes down to three main steps.** First, create and maintain an internet presence. Next, use lead-generation methods to draw website traffic. Finally, capture, connect, cultivate, and close leads. Once you have these steps in place, you can repeat them to generate a steady stream of internet leads.

To draw traffic to your website, you can use keywords, pay to show up higher in Google search results, or create content to organically attract people. Don’t forget about offline marketing. Your website URL should be included in every piece of your offline marketing. Someone doesn’t have to learn about your website from the internet to visit it.&nbsp;

We discussed closing on leads at length [in our last blog post,](https://realestatecareersinutah.com/stay-ahead-of-the-market-by-getting-to-the-table.html) but to summarize, you need to have a system to keep in touch with your leads. **As a rule, speed is king.** Usually, whoever talks to someone first has the best chance of converting. In Phoenix, the average time it takes to reach out to a lead is seven seconds after it first arrives. Make sure you have a system in place to talk to leads as soon as possible.&nbsp;
