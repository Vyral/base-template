If you bought or refinanced your home when mortgage rates were super low, like 3% or 3.5%, you might be reluctant to move now and lose that great rate. However, you must remember; your mortgage rate is not the only thing to consider. **If you're on the fence, look at some of the top reasons other homeowners are still selling.**

Many people move to be closer to loved ones or because they're retiring or just need more space. If you want a change in location or a home that may better suit your needs, it may be time to sell.
