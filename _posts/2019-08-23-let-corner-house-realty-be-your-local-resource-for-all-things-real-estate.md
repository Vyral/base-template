For the past several months, I’ve featured many fantastic local businesses on this video blog. Now, I’d like to take the opportunity to introduce you to another: my own. With the help of my wife and my team of fellow agents, Corner House Realty has become something very special within our Baltimore Metro area. It’s always been our goal to serve as a resource to the community, not only by helping buyers and sellers fulfil their real estate goals, but also by providing insight into the market in general. For more information, check out our website ([www.cornerhouserealty.com](www.cornerhouserealty.com){: target="_blank"}) or visit us in person at 1717 Edmondson Avenue in Catonsville. Otherwise, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
