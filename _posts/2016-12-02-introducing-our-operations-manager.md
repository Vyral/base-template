Today, we’ll go behind the scenes and talk to Liz Eppleman, our operations manager, about how she helps our real estate team and our clients succeed.

Today I want to go behind the scenes and show you a little bit of how our real estate team works. Having a team allows us to give you the very best service possible. Our goal is to help you find your dream home or sell your home for top dollar in as little time as possible. I’m excited to introduce you to Liz Eppleman, our operations manager.

**As operations manager, Liz is in charge of assisting the full-time agents on our team.** She helps them with marketing, client care, contracts, and settlements, so Liz has a well-rounded set of skills.

As for marketing properties, Liz takes pride in the professional photos that we take of all of our listings. These professional photos highlight all of the wonderful aspects of the house, both inside and outside. Not only will the photos of your home look beautiful, Liz also uses Facebook to boost your listing. Liz can create and advertise to a specific audience, which allows your listing to reach thousands of people interested in buying in your area.

When it comes to client care, Liz will give you a call to introduce herself after you meet your agent. **Liz is there to help you with anything you need.**

People want to know why our team is so successful, and a lot of our success comes from people like Liz who work behind the agents. If you have any questions for Liz or if you would like to learn more about our real estate team, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
