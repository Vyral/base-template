Tulsa Looks Good on You and it looks so sweet on Modern Cottage.

Jennie connected with local entrepreneur and owner of Modern Cottage, Morgan, to hear the surprising backstory of this sweet Cherry Street store.

> **“I come from a great family of business owners**. My great, great grandfather opened a hardware store in Collinsville back in 1887. In those days, hardware stores had a much wider range of products and services, so he had his hands full. He was even elected mayor of Collinsville! Then the hardware store was passed down throughout the generations.
>
> Eventually, the hardware store was passed down to my grandparents. However, when Walmart came to town in the 80s, they were driven out of business. The hardware store had been open for 95 years, and my mother had grown up in it as a child. When the store closed, she never let go of the dream of owning her own business.

*“I always tell people that if they have an entrepreneurial dream, they can make it happen.”*

> When my mother retired, she achieved her dream by opening a vintage store in Owasso. I worked there as a teenager, and&nbsp;**I knew from that moment on that I wanted to be a business owner**. I held onto this dream long enough to open Modern Cottage in 2017 with my father as co-owner.
>
> I was inspired to open this business because I’ve always been interested in home goods. My mother was an interior designer when I was a child, and I always wanted input on my room. Opening Modern Cottage just seemed like a natural fit. I decided to open on Cherry Street because it’s such a beautiful place. It’s surrounded by a lovely community and historic buildings that add a ton of charm to the area.
