What's going on with the market? We keep getting asked the same question, and it's such a weird funk in the market. We have low inventory. Why do we have low inventory? Because most sellers who purchased at 2.5% and 3% or even 3.5% interest rates and who came in with money down—Where will they go? If they sell their current home to downsize, their mortgage will be about the same, if not more, so making a move doesn't make sense unless something is pressing.

For all of the listing appointments that we're going to, we're noticing many people moving out of state. You're selling in California to buy somewhere else for cash or a fairly low loan amount, or there is an extenuating circumstance. After 22 years, who do I call when I have a problem? **They end up calling Ron**. We go through the consult, but many of the listings we see are usually moving out of state or under extenuating circumstances.

We're not getting a lot of sellers who are downsizing or moving because they will be increasing their monthly mortgage payments. We talked about this last year when we told everybody that even though the housing market will adjust and the prices will come down a little, that spike in the interest rate will affect your purchase. The ones that didn't listen, we're happy to find a home for you; we'll figure it out.

On the other hand, the sellers insisting that there's low inventory still have to be priced according to the market. We're not saying give away your house—nobody wants that. But buyers are also being stung with a higher interest rate. For a lot of people, it has to make sense. Suppose you want to be successful in your sale, and you want to move. In that case, you have to adjust and understand that even though something a year ago sold for $900,000 and your offers aren't coming in, interest rates were different. It was a different feeling all around, which affected the higher-end pricing. **We still see consistent multiple offers and quick sales on houses ranging from $400,000 to $700,000**. But above that threshold, we see longer days on market and negotiation.
