We’re back today with another installment of the bathroom remodelling process.

Today we’re continuing to talk about the bathroom remodel process.

To do so, I met up with Ross Jorgensen of Rosco Construction—who is helping a friend of ours remodel three bathrooms, including a full bath, a guest bath, and a half bath.

Protecting certain features in the room is important, he told me, since he and his team will be coming in and out of the rooms with heavy equipment.

After they tear out the things that must be removed, they will need to adjust the plumbing. Since granite is being installed, they must also rip out all of the sheet rock in preparation.

Now, the particular home they’re working on does have downstairs bathrooms so the remodeling will not impede the homeowners, but there are cases where remodeling makes all of a home’s bathrooms totally inaccessible.

Ross says people should be mindful of instances like this, **since the entire process takes between three to five weeks.**

Next time, we’ll show you what everything looks like once it’s been torn up.

If you have any other questions or want more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
