Is there a housing crash on the horizon? We don’t think so, and there are eight key reasons behind our perspective:&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **The state of subprime loans.** Before the crash in 2008, subprime loans constituted $620 billion and made up 20% of the total mortgage market. Today subprime loans account for just $56 billion (5%) of the total mortgage market. Right now, loans are of higher quality than they have been since before the last crash.&nbsp;
2. **Credit scores have increased.** Over the last 15 years, FICO scores have been steadily rising. In 2009, the average credit score for borrowers seeking a loan was 686. In 2001, it dropped down to between 490 and 510. Since then, though, we’ve seen significant improvements.&nbsp;
3. **Lending is far more strict.** CoreLogic’s Housing Credit Index reports that loans originated in 2016 were of higher quality than any filed in the last 15 years. Tightened lending standards have reduced the impact of fix-and-flip investors. Currently, lenders only finance 55% of home value in the “flip” market. This is a major shift from the 80% or more banks lent out during the subprime crisis.&nbsp;
4. **The number of homes sold right now is 20% below the pre-crash peak.** Right now, there’s less than two months’ worth of available inventory in Orange County.&nbsp;
5. **Young people are having to save more money due to the past recession.** As a result of this, homebuyers are submitting larger down payments in recent times, which provides an additional level of security in their real estate investment.&nbsp;
6. **Total home equity is still significantly lower than in 2006.** Instead of an explosion of home values, recent growth has been steady. There was $85 billion in equity in 2006, and today there is about $14 billion.&nbsp;
7. **Home prices today make sense if you factor in inflation.** Between 2012 and 2017, home prices have risen 6.5% per year on average, and surpassed their 2006 peak as a result. However, these increased prices actually indicate an adjustment for the 11 years of inflation we’ve seen.
8. **Home builders are focusing on high-end properties.** This is likely due to changes in demand, but the question of whether demand is stronger today than in the past is one no one can definitively answer.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: No one has a crystal ball, but looking to recent market data and forming an educated perspective based on that information can help you gain a general sense of where things may be headed.&nbsp;
