Here are a few simple tips to prevent mold from growing inside your home.

Mold—it’s become a word with such negative connotations that I believe the majority of home inspectors will start calling it “fungal growth.”

No matter what it’s called, **it’s important that you keep it from growing in your home, and today I’ll tell you how.&nbsp;**

Mold can come in many forms. In fact, there are over 10,000 varieties of it. Different molds thrive in different environments, and the varieties that grow outdoors tend to be very different than that which grow indoors, but generally speaking, the varieties that grow indoors can be seen to the naked eye.&nbsp;

All these varieties of mold can generally be broken down into five types—four of which can grow inside your home but aren’t considered dangerous. The fifth mold—also known as “black mold”—is the one that can cause serious health problems if you’re exposed to it long term. Black mold occurs most often in continuously damp environments, and if it’s detected in a home inspection, it’s always a good idea to get it removed.&nbsp;

Studies have shown that up to 50% of all homes have experienced some type of mold growth. **The good news is, routine cleaning can prevent it from becoming a problem.** Make sure you use vacuums with HEPA filters when cleaning your carpets, and use detergents to clean the surface areas of your home that are continually exposed to water and moisture.

Mold needs nutrients and moisture in order to survive, and it thrives in warm environments under a broad temperature range. In this case, “nutrients” can include carpet or drywall, so there’s not much you can do about removing that kind of thing. You can, however, control the moisture in your home, so make sure the crawl spaces and other areas in your basement are well ventilated.

In short, good house-cleaning habits are all you need to keep mold at bay. If you have any questions about this topic or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
