When is the best time to list your home?

A lot of people assume the answer is spring because there are usually a lot of buyers looking to move during this time, but because of this, a lot of houses come on the market as well. What happens, then, is that supply and demand mirror each other. As a result, June is typically the months with the highest number of closings, and after that, it trickles downward before spiking again in August.&nbsp;

In any case, **people buy homes all 12 months out of the year,** and buyers that are in the market during the fall and winter are typically more serious than the spring and summer buyers. I’ve even sold homes on Christmas Eve. Why? Because buyers who are out and about during this time have to buy. If you list in the spring and summer, your home may generate more foot traffic, but you won’t deal with as many buyers who are actually serious about buying.

You also need to consider the specifics of your home. If your property benefits from certain features (e.g., a powerline in the backyard) being hidden by foliage, or if you have really nice landscaping, then you’re definitely better off listing while everything is in bloom.&nbsp;

Aside from these factors, **the best time to list your home is when you’re ready.** Everybody’s situation is different, but don’t assume that just because you missed the spring market this year, you have to skip the fall and winter and wait until next year. Fall and winter are prime seasons to sell because of ultra-motivated buyers and a lack of competition from other sellers.&nbsp;

To know whether you’re ready or not, ask yourself why you’re moving and how that affects your timeline. I’d love to have this conversation with you, so if you’d like to talk one-on-one about the best time for you to sell, don’t hesitate to give me a call.&nbsp;
