It’s springtime, which means that many homeowners are preparing their homes to list on the market. But what all goes into preparing a home for the market? Today, I have some tips and advice.

**1. Use professional photography.&nbsp;**One of the very first things a buyer will see is a picture of your home online. These days, we only have seconds to impress, so having the best shot with the best photography is your opportunity to hook a buyer.

**2. Maintain your curb appeal.&nbsp;**Similarly to the first point, you need to make a great first impression when the buyer actually gets the home, which means that the exterior of your home needs to be in top shape. It may sound very specific, but your front door area is one of the most critical points to maintain in order make a lasting, positive impression.

**3. Clean up your backyard.** Make sure your backyard presents a lifestyle. This doesn’t mean that you need to go all out; just make sure you define the area with some plants or flowers and some neat outdoor furniture. Let your buyers imagine themselves enjoying the backyard, rather than seeing it as a project to be maintained.

If you have any questions about preparing your home for the market or selling in general, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
