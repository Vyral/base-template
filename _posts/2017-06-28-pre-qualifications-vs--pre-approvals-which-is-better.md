What’s the difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval?

<br>According to JJ Mazzo of Summit Funding, the biggest difference is that with a pre-qualification lenders will take an application and run your credit, but they take factors like your income and assets only as a verbal affirmation. They don’t necessarily verify all of the hard evidence and documentation, and pre-qualifications also aren’t reviewed by an underwriter.

<br>**With a pre-approval, however, lenders have all the documentation they need** to give the seller the peace of mind they need. Unlike pre-qualifications, pre-approvals are reviewed by an underwriter, which allows the buyer to shop with more confidence.

<br>In the eyes of a seller, the difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval is huge. When a seller reviews an offer, a buyer who is pre-approved has a much higher standing. Oftentimes, we win out on a lot of our bids because our buyers have a pre-approval letter.

<br>When it comes to increasing the number of properties our clients are able to win, **JJ and his team also have a 10-day close guarantee** which states that for every day that they’re late to the closing, they give $100 to the seller. This gives the seller the peace of mind that if they can’t perform, they still have skin in the game. It’s 10 total calendar days, too—not business days.

<br>Sellers want their money and they want it fast, so we want to give our buyers the leverage to give them what they’re asking for. Being able to partner with JJ and his team has been a huge deal for our buyers to help them qualify for and win the properties they want. If you’d like to reach out to JJ, you can call him at (877) 237-9694 or email him at [jj@mazzogroup.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(106,106,64,109,97,122,122,111,103,114,111,117,112,46,99,111,109))).
