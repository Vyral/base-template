The main question we keep getting asked by buyers is, “Why isn’t my offer getting accepted?” I had a conversation with someone recently who wrote 33 offers for homes and still hasn’t gotten one accepted. He did the things his real estate agent guided him to do, but he’s still losing out on the houses he wants.&nbsp;

In this hyper-seller’s market, **you need to have a conversation with your loan officer about where to start looking**. For example, if you’re pre-approved for $400,000, you may need to look for homes in the $370,000 range because homes are selling for above list and appraisal price. Don’t stretch yourself so that your life becomes difficult after you buy a home; you need to strategize with your agent about how to look for homes that won’t break your budget. These conversations are crucial because buyers are getting fatigued and missing out on opportunities.&nbsp;

There’s a strategy to buying in this real estate market, so **with the right Realtor and loan officer, you’ll find the house that works for you and your family.** With so many people going on vacations right now, more opportunities are opening up for buyers. Don’t give up; you *can* get the home you desire.&nbsp;
