One of the questions we often get around January 1st of every year is, "How do I take advantage of St. George Real Estate in the coming new year?" I've got three very simple and practical tips for every St. George homeowner as we move into 2017.

**1. You need to determine your home's current market value.**

The rationale for this is you might want to use the equity in your property for, say, home improvements or take that equity and trade over or trade up to a new home. You can do that online at a free home valuation site like <a href="http://www.dixiehomevalue.com/" target="_blank">DixieHomeValue.com</a>, <a href="http://zillow.com" target="_blank">Zillow.com</a>, or contact an appraiser who can conduction an independent appraisal for about $350.00.

**2. Every homeowner who has a mortgage should consider a refinance.**

A refinance can save you between $100 and $300 per month on your mortgage during 2017 and many years beyond. So don’t walk, RUN to a good Lender and see if you qualify!
We work the best lenders in St. George daily. One of our favorites is Chantry Abbott of Guild Mortgage. He can be reached at 435-979-1775. Here’s a video we shot with him last year: <a href="http://www.soldinstgeorge.com/1-reason-home-buyers-dreams-may-crushed/" target="_blank">http://www.soldinstgeorge.com/1-reason-home-buyers-dreams-may-crushed/</a>

**3. Finally, every homeowner should consider purchasing an investment property.**

Now that you own your own home, you might want to consider investing in a property that a stranger will pay the mortgage on, and build your retirement nest egg. How cool is that?
If you don’t have copy of the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/HOLD-Find-Rent-Houses-Wealth/dp/0071797041" target="_blank">Hold</a>”, please contact us at 435-215-4533 and if you mention this blog post, we’ll give you a FREE copy! It’s arguably the finest book on investing in real estate ever written.
Those are three very simple tips to help you have a profitable and happy real estate year in 2017.


If you have any questions about selecting the right lender, determining your home's value, or finding an investment property please give us a call and we'll help point you in the right direction!
