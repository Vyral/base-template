Today I’m joined by special guest Kim Drury from Angel Properties to talk about long-term leasing as a strategy for your team and your buyers. She answered a few questions for us about what she does as a leasing agent and how she helps investors avoid potential pitfalls throughout the process.

*How is a leasing agent different from a property manager?*

**A property manager’s objective is to take care of the property, while a leasing agent’s job is to maximize the net profit for a property owner.** Taking care of the property is important, but it’s also important to minimize vacancy costs by determining the correct pricing, the utilities, and more. Leasing agents minimize risk for the property owner and are licensed to facilitate a lease. Under licensing laws in Utah, property managers are unable to do this.

*How are nightly rentals different than 30-day rentals?*

In Park City, there are a lot of nightly rentals, but people may not know that if someone is staying in a property for more than 30 days, they gain tenancy rights to the property and the owner can’t just ask that person to leave even if there isn’t a lease in place. A state-standardized lease goes into effect after 30 days. **As a leasing agent, we want to protect the owner and mitigate some of those potential problems prior to placing someone in the property.**

If you have any questions for Kim about this topic, feel free to give her a call at (435) 640-6025. Stay tuned for part two of our series that is coming in a few weeks.

In the meantime, if you have any questions for me or any real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
