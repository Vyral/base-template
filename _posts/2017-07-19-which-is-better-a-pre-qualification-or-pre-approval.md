What is the difference between a pre-qualification letter and a pre-approval? As a buyer, which one is stronger? As a seller, which one will make you more comfortable about your home sale?

**If you get pre-qualified, the lender simply looks through your finances** for things like your credit score, assets, income, and liabilities. Then, based on whatever information you tell the lender, they will give you a pre-qualification letter.

A pre-approval is a lot strong stronger than pre-qualification. The lender will verify your financial information by looking through bank statements, W-2s, tax returns, and pay stubs. That way, when you submit your offer, the seller knows that there won’t be any financial roadblocks in the way of closing.

A pre-approval letter gives the seller one less thing to worry about. As a buyer, a pre-approval letter can set you apart from the competition in a multiple offer situation. Even if you are the only buyer submitting an offer, you are more likely to get the home. **You may even be able to get a better price on the home.**

Ultimately, in today’s market, a pre-approval can be the difference between getting a house or not getting a house. So, when you talk to your lender, make sure that you get pre-approved, not pre-qualified.
