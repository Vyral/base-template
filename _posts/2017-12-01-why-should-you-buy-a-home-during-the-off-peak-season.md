When people think of buying a home, they often naturally gravitate towards the spring market. As a result, spring is a common time for buyers to enter the market.

However, buyer traffic is very heavy in the springtime. In low inventory markets, some of our listings may get as many as 25 to 30 showings over the course of one weekend in the spring. As a buyer looking to buy a home, particularly a first home, it can be intimidating to buy a home in the spring. It may even feel hopeless at times.

The benefit of trying the market in an off-peak season is **that the buyer is able to explore what’s out there without all of the competition.**&nbsp;Shopping for a home in off-peak seasons like fall and winter also increases the likelihood that you will find a home.

If you are searching for a home this winter, we recommend that you get written verification from sellers regarding certain winterization projects.

After all, the AC unit should be shut off and the sprinkler system should be winterized, which means the inspector won’t be able to test them in the winter. Just ask for the seller to **confirm that those things were working before they were properly shut down in the fall.**

If you have any questions about buying a home in the winter market, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
