Hands down, remodeling a kitchen before you sell will get you the best return on your investment. Today I’ll go over a few things you can do to update your kitchen if you’re on a budget.

Kitchens are the number one selling factor in a house, which is why I want to talk about the best ways to update yours before you put your home on the market.

A beautiful, updated kitchen will get you top dollar every time. The kitchen being remodeled in the video above is going from a very small to a very large kitchen, but **most remodels don’t need to be that extensive.**

There are a few things you can do if you don’t have the budget for a complete remodel. If you have golden oak cabinets, have them painted or go to a darker stain. Replace fixtures and make the switch to a gas cooktop. Additionally, **if you have Formica countertops you’ll want to update to granite or quartz.**

You might not even be thinking about selling your home anytime soon and that’s fine, but when you do decide to sell, **you’ll get the best return on your investment if you update the kitchen.**

If you have any questions about updating your kitchen, updating other parts of your home, or if you’re nervous about putting money into an update, I’d be happy to come by and talk with you about your options. If you have any other real estate-related questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
