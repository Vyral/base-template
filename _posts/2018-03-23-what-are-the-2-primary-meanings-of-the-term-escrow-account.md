The term “escrow account” is one you’ve likely heard pretty often. But, what does it mean?

The term actually refers to a couple of different things.

**The first meaning has to do with a buyer’s earnest deposit.** As a buyer, once you’re under contract on a home, you’ll be expected to pay something called earnest money. Earnest money refers to the deposit paid to confirm a contract. In our market, this money typically goes to the listing agent’s office.

**This money is held in a third-party account known as an escrow account.** After your deal is worked out and you’re headed to closing, the third party releases the money and it will be credited on the settlement statement.

Second of all, there is the matter of escrow accounts as they pertain to home loans. **When you make a monthly mortgage payment, the mortgage company collects a certain amount of money to put into an escrow account.&nbsp;**This money that is collected each month is set aside for your homeowners insurance and property taxes.

The amount taken by the mortgage company will vary from year to year, so they evaluate it annually. Some years you may receive a check back and other times, the company may ask for additional funds.
