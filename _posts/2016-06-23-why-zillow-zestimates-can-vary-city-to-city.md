A lot of people look at Zillow Zestimates to determine the value of their home. Zillow themselves state that they have an 8% accuracy margin. What does that mean? It means that if your house is worth, say, a million bucks, they’re within a $80,000 range of its true value.

That accuracy margin is based on a national average. City by city, it can vary. Same goes for counties, too. For example, here in Orange County it’s more accurate than cities like Irvine that have master-planned communities because Zestimates are more accurate in uniform neighborhoods.

There are also cities where it’s probably skewed greater than the 8% national average, like Costa Mesa (specifically the east-side), where you’ll find small, original houses that were built in the 60s and 70s and haven’t been upgraded sitting next to a brand new house built as a row home, or sitting next to a duplex. The point is that it’s not a master-planned community, and this greater margin happens because Zestimates are less accurate in original neighborhoods.

The CEO of Zillow himself sold his own home last year in Seattle for 40% less than his Zestimate. This is ironic considering Seattle’s own accuracy margin is only 6%, or 2% less than the national average. That’s a $700,000 error!
