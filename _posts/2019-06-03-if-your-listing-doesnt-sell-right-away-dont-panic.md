Last week, a very worried client told me that they’d put their house on the market for sale, and in three days, they hadn’t gotten a contract—what should they do\!?

My advice? **Don’t panic\!** Sometimes it takes just a few days to sell in our market, while other times it can take weeks—even if you have a good agent and property that’s well priced and in good condition.

So, in the case of my client whose home had been on the market for just three days, there’s really no reason to panic. If you don’t have any showings, offers, or inquiries after five or seven days, however, I’d say it’s time to re-evaluate.&nbsp;

How does your house actually look? Have you staged it? Does the property smell? Is it accessible? Is it overpriced? How are you advertising it? What else has come onto the market since you first listed your home?&nbsp;

Talk to your agent about what adjustments you should make to garner more attention for your listing. **Typically, if your price, condition, and marketing are all properly aligned to the market, your house should sell.** But if it doesn’t, remember not to panic.

If you need an advisor to help you boost the appeal of your listing to that buyers will come flocking in, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you succeed.
