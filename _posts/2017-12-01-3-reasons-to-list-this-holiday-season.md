Something we’ve learned over the last few years is that the holidays are a great time of year to sell your home. Many agents like to take this time of the year off, but we don’t.

That isn’t to say we don’t enjoy time with our friends and families. Rather, we simply owe it to our clients to keep working as hard as it can. If you’re thinking of listing your property, here are a few reasons to do so during the holidays:

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Less competition.** People who aren’t serious about selling their homes aren’t going to do so during the holiday season. As a seller, this will help your home stand out because buyers have fewer to choose from.
2. **Homes show well during the holidays.** Lights, decorations, and other signs of holiday cheer all increase the success rate of a home showing.
3. **Fewer casual buyers.** Similarly to the first point, buyers looking for homes at this time of year are doing so because they are serious. Although there are fewer homes for sale during the holidays, there aren’t fewer buyers. Relocation buyers are also very active during this time of year.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
