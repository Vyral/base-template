The year-end numbers are in for the Charlotte real estate market, so I have a quick update to share with you today. Over the past year, our number of new listings is up, sales are up, and inventory is down. The days on market are also dropping steadily, with the median price jumping up 11.1% from $242,000 to $269,000. These numbers may just be measuring one month, but they’re a good indicator of where our market is headed.&nbsp;

Interest rates are still low, which is keeping the market hot. We haven’t seen any signs that they might go up, but we’ll be keeping an eye on them for you. If we can help you or answer any questions, feel free to reach out via phone or email today. We look forward to hearing from you.
