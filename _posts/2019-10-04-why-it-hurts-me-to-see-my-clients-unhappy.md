Are you happy with the way your career, your relationships, and your life are going? If you aren’t, I have some good advice to share with you today.

The fall market is here. The leaves are changing and, quite frankly, the real estate market is changing, too. Interest rates are still very low, so it’s a great time to buy a home and lock in a 30-year mortgage. At the same time, the market is fragmented. Certain segments are doing very well, while other segments are struggling. It all depends on your personal situation.&nbsp;

**What I really want to talk about today is your happiness.** I’ve been meeting with a lot of clients lately who are absolutely miserable. Are you happy in life? If the answer is yes, are you wicked happy? If you’re not wicked happy, what’s it going to take to get you there?

**I learned from Tony Robbins that we don’t change until the pain of staying becomes greater than the pain of changing.** Change always has pain associated with it. What kind of pain is it going to take for you to make a change?

I also learned from Tony that we live a life based on standards. If you raise your standards, you raise your quality of life. If you raise what you’re willing to accept in your life, you’ll change it.

How are your standards? Are you happy with your relationships? With your career? With your finances? **I’m fortunate enough that my answer is yes to all of these.** I love coming to work every day and helping people solve their problems.&nbsp;

**If you don’t feel the same way in your career, maybe it’s time for a career change.** If your finances aren’t giving you the freedom to do what you want in life, maybe it’s time to set up a savings plan to get to where you want to be.

I hate to see my clients when they’re not happy. If you’re not happy, give me a call or send me an email today. Let’s have a chat about you, what excites you, and how I can help you live an amazing life.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
