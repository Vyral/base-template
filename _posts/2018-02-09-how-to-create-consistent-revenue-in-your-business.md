I’m happy to be joined once again by Scott Agnew, who’s back to share his expertise with all of us. Today we’re going to explore the topic of how to create a steady stream of income in your real estate business. Scott got his license at 18 and has been in real estate since then, so he has a wealth of knowledge to share with everyone. Here are some highlights from my interview with Scott:

**What’s your No. 1 tip for creating consistent revenue in a real estate business?**

Relationships, which are built through consistent contact over time. **The more time we’re able to spend sharing knowledge with others, the better off they will be.** We become a trusted resource over time by consistently bringing value in the form of tips, offers, and just being there to answer any questions.

**What’s the best use of an agent’s dollars for staying engaged with clients?**

A good rule of thumb is that whenever a client uses your services, you **take a small percentage of the revenue that they bring to you and find a way to reinvest those dollars back into providing value** to all of the people who have committed to you. There’s a big difference between a one-time commission check and a commission check that comes with a raving fan attached. The goal should be to create as many raving fans as possible.

**What is the best tactical tool that an agent could put into play here?**

Short videos. Building relationships used to be an information game, but today things are a little different because of the sheer amount of information there is to sort through. To be able to distill it down into a concise and succinct message means delivering content and delivering value in an easy-to-digest way. You want to give them information that’s so good that they would pay for it. I’m talking about fresh, unique, original content.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
