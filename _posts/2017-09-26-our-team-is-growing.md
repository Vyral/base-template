It’s a lovely September day in St. George and there’s a career opportunity ahead. Is it for you? For someone you know?

We’ve had explosive growth on our team. We’re running a highly successful real estate business and we’re looking for some administrative support.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**Specifically, we’re looking to hire a “Listing Coordinator.”**

This is a KEY admin / operations position who will interface with our home-selling clients on the “front lines” daily.  This salaried position does NOT require a real estate license, but a license or experience in real estate is preferred.

**If you or someone you know is dynamic, likes working with people, and is highly detail-oriented, we want to hear from you.** <a href="https://wizehire.com/job/listing-coordinator-marketing-admin-licensed-real-estate-in-st-george-ut-9382ed681ccc0902" target="_blank">**CLICK HERE**</a> to apply! We’ll be in touch if we think there’s a fit.

Best,
Jeremy & Team
