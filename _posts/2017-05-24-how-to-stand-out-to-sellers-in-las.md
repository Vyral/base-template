When you want to buy a home here in the hot Las Vegas market, there are a few certain things you can do to make yourself stand out amongst the competition.

If you want to buy a Las Vegas home, there are a few specific things you can do to get the home you want for a great deal.

**1. Choose an experienced agent:** You want a full-time agent who knows what they're doing. They should be patient and willing to show you properties. It's also not just about finding your house, you want an agent who can negotiate and be aggressive to get your offer accepted.

**2. Be aggressive with your offer:** When you find the right property in the right area that fits your criteria (size, price, budget, etc.) don't sit there and over-analyze things.

**3. Have your full financing approval ready:** Make sure you have a copy before you even start shopping for homes. Not having your approval ready would be like going hunting without a gun. Even if you find the perfect home, if you haven't been approved for financing yet, it could take a lot of time and cause you to lose out on the house.

Stay tuned for our next video where I'll reveal the last three things you can do as a homebuyer to set yourself up to win the home you want. In the meantime, give me a call or send me an email with any questions you have. I'd be glad to help!
