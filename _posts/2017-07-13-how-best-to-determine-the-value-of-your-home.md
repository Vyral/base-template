There are more than a few different ways that you can determine the value of your home. Today I’ve listed four of them:

**The assessed value.** You go to the county assessor’s website and look up the property by its address and you should be able to see the assessed value of the home.

**An online valuation tool**, such as Zillow. This is not as accurate as Zillow doesn’t come to see your home personally, but can give you a starting point as to what your home might be worth.

**The appraised value.** You can hire an appraiser and get their opinion. When it’s not specific to a transaction, this value can be pretty general.

**A competitive market analysis.** This is the best way to get an assessment of your home’s value, as it means we compare your home to like properties in the area, with similar square footage, that have sold in the last three months, as well as active listings on the market currently. Additionally, when we look at the photos from those other homes, we will also be comparing them to the amenities in your home to determine the best fair market value for your property.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’d like to get a comparative market analysis for your home, give a call. We would be happy to assist you!
