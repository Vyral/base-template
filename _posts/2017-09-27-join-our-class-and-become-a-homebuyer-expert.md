On October 21st at the Umpqua Bank in the Pearl, Michele DesCombes will be teaching another home buying class.

This class is intended for anyone who is interested in buying a home, whether you’ve owned one before, it’s been awhile since your last purchase, or this is your first home purchase.

During this session, Michele will be covering a lot of great information about our market. As you might’ve noticed, it’s has shifted a little bit in favor of buyers, even though inventory is still a little low. She’ll also discuss what your options are in the home buying process as well as which loan programs are available for first-time homebuyers or low-income buyers who can qualify for a grant.

If you’re renting right now, you’re probably paying at least 30% of your income on your rent. If you were to purchase a home using a grant program or any of the fantastic loan programs available out there, you could pay as little as 15% of your income.<br><br>Michele will be teaching with Mac Dengsot of Umpqua bank, a home loan specialist. They both can answer your questions about anything regarding the process.
