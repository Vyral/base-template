This week’s question comes from Andrew and Marsha, who ask: **“Is this the right time to cash in equity and move up to a luxury home?”**

This is a very smart question because it definitely reflects our current trends and market movement. If your house no longer fits your needs and you’re planning to buy a luxury home, now is the best time to make that change.

Statistics show us that in today’s premium home market, buyers are in control. **The luxury market’s current inventory far exceeds the number of buyers.** This means that luxury homes have been staying on the market longer, which eventually leads to price reductions.

Startup homes or trade-up home listings will often attract bidding wars. So, it may be time for you to put your home on the market.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want help listing your home, feel free to give my team and I a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
