</i><div style="text-align: left;">Youve probably heard of the property website Airbnb before. You may have even stayed in an Airbnb property before. My own family has stayed in Airbnb properties all over the world. Its a great way for homeowners and investors to make a little bit of extra money, and more buyers are purchasing properties lately to use for this sole purpose.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">If youre thinking of listing your current home on Airbnb or buying a rental property to use as a rental property for Airbnb, there are a few questions you should ask yourself to know if youre making the right choice.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">First, **have you picked a good location?** As the first rule of real estate goes: location, location, location. In order to be a successful investment, demand for lodging has to exist in your specified area. It wouldnt make sense to have an Airbnb property in a place that has very little tourism. Your property should be close to attractions and transportation. A good view helps, as well. <div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">For your Airbnb to be a successful investment, it has to be in the right area. <div style="text-align: left;">Second, **how much time and energy are you willing to invest?** Airbnb properties dont rent themselves. Youre expected to provide a clean space, and guests will expect certain things like clean towels, tourist information, and a way to reach you in case they have any problems. Hosting can be difficult and time consuming. You can hire a service to remove some of that burden, but that doesnt come cheap. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Third, **are you hosting Airbnb by the book?** In places like New York and San Diego, theyre cracking down on properties because theyre greatly affecting the hospitality industry. Laws and regulations are always changing, so you need to make sure youre following all of the rules and paying all necessary taxes in your area. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Renting out your place on Airbnb may not be a full-time business endeavor, but make no mistakeit requires effort and attention to detail. Consider that before buying or renting a property on Airbnb. <div style="text-align: left;">
