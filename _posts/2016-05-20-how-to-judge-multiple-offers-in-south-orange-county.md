If you have multiple offers on your home, it’s important to know how to evaluate them.

**It starts with price, but even that isn’t the bottom line.**Is it an all cash offer? Does it have a loan? What are the risks? You also need to consider timing; maybe you have a baby on the way or you want to wait until the end of the school year. Does the offer meet your needs?

Know who is paying for what in the offer. Who is paying for title insurance, the escrow, home warranty, City/County transfer fees and HOA transfer fees? **These costs should be outlined in the offer.** The escrow fees, for example, are usually split 50-50. Buyers will typically ask the seller to pay for most of the other items, but please remember, they’re negotiable!

You need to know what’s included in the offer; **things permanently affixed to the house are considered to be part of it.** If you want to make sure something is excluded, work with your agent to ensure it’s properly noted in the listing. If you want to keep that antique mirror hanging above the bathroom sink or the chandelier in the entry way, you need to disclose that those items are not included.

**Consider the buyer’s deposit – the bigger it is, the more committed the buyer typically is.** See if they included a pre-approval letter, and make sure it meets the dollar amount of your offer and has a current date.

Finally, you want to consider whether or not this offer is a conditional offer. **The most common example is a seller needing to sell an existing house in order to buy your house.**Can you live with that, or is that a deal breaker? Don’t rule them out completely.

To get ahead, we recommend sellers get a home inspection done before listing. Buyers will pay for inspections after the offer process, but by getting an inspection before listing, you’ll know ahead of time if you need to make repairs or if you have any issues that decrease your property’s value.
