2802 Sunkist Drive just came on the market, and I’m excited to give you this exclusive look at it.&nbsp;

I was recently a guest once again on “List It Live” and I had the opportunity to showcase another gorgeous home that has recently come on the market.&nbsp;

**Listed at $799,000, this home is located at 2802 Sunkist Drive in Vista.&nbsp;**

This 3-bedroom, 4.5-bath home has had just one owner since it was custom-built in 1985. The home itself is 3,030 square feet, and the property encompasses 1.19 acres—every inch of which is fully fenced. The grounds are loaded with fruit trees, and there’s also a well that irrigates the property for free. In addition, you’ll find a solar panel system installed on the roof.&nbsp;

The home was built in three levels—the lowest of which has an indoor/outdoor pool and a rec room that’s great for entertaining. Above that, the main level features an open floor plan, and a huge walkaround deck runs along the outside of the kitchen and dining room areas, offering a beautiful sunrise view each morning. On the top level, the master bedroom connects to a west-facing balcony. Overall, this home is in great shape and is move-in ready.&nbsp;
