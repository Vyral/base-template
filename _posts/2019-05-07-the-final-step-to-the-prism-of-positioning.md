Last time, we talked about the prism of positioning, or positioning your home with price, condition, and accessibility so it will sell quickly and for top dollar in this market. However, I left out a very important component.&nbsp;

**After we position the property with the three things we mentioned above, there’s one more step: negotiation.** Negotiation is the last component in getting the most money in your pocket possible.&nbsp;

When you hire an agent, make sure they have their act together when it comes to the prism of positioning, but **once you get a buyer, you need an experienced, seasoned negotiation in order to come out on top.**

Make sure that you’ve got an agent who can give you the right advice on what to do with one, two, or even eight offers, which is possible in this market. Do you counter? Accept? Let it go?&nbsp;

The answer is that you need to accept the offer that’s to your advantage and will put the most money in your pocket at the end of the day. The true value of your real estate agent is to find the right buyer and get a good net with good terms and a smooth transaction.
