<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how we’ve adapted your real estate experience to keep you safe and satisfied during the pandemic.</em></p>

During these times of uncertainty, we’re excited to offer you the newly updated marketing strategy that allows us to adhere to all social distancing and CDC recommendations to provide you and your family with a safe, stress-free experience.&nbsp;

We offer you **virtual consultations** to guide you step by step through the home buying process. We can even help you identify your to-do list so you can prepare your home for sale.

We’ve invested in creative technologies such as **interactive 3D tours and cinematic videos** to capture all of the details in your home so buyers can view your property online from the comfort and safety of their own homes.&nbsp; We utilize social media to host virtual open houses to get your home in front of thousands of buyers.&nbsp;

We can also provide a **video tour of any property** you would like to see or arrange an in-person showing if necessary, all while offering preventative measures to ensure everyone’s safety. Of course, **all contracts and paperwork can be signed digitally** from your favorite device.

If you need any help with your real estate transaction, reach out to us. Let us put our new virtual marketing to work for you.
