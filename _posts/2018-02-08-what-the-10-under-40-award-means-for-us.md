Recently, my team and I had the honor of receiving the Columbus Realtors 10 Under 40 Award for 2017. In response to this, many people have been asking for more details.

**The 10 Under 40 is an award given to 10 Columbus Realtors under the age of 40 who demonstrate excellence based on four criteria.**

The first criterion is sales and volume. Essentially, **this criterion verifies successful production on the part of the Realtor.**

The second criterion is community and professional involvement. Qualifying Realtors must demonstrate that they are active in the community and in local professional circles.

The third criterion, business strategy, refers to whether the Realtor has a specific plan for consistently growing, maintaining, and executing their business.

Finally, the last criterion is the “X-factor.” This encompasses all unique attributes or factors that an agent fitting the three previous categories might possess. In other words, **this final criterion determines what separates the award winners from the other applicants.**

For my team, what sets us apart is our personal, conversational approach to real estate.

We’re very proud to receive this award and it was great to be recognized for our accomplishments. Of course, we always strive to continue to grow.
