Whether you’re planning on listing in six weeks or in six months, there are three simple steps you can (and should) do right now to prepare if you want to sell quickly, easily, and for top dollar:

* **Begin making simple improvements to your home**. One of the very first things our team does when meeting with a new seller is walk through their property and point out any areas that should be upgraded or repaired in order to increase the value and appeal of the home. Of course, we will also make sure that these repairs are cost effective—you should avoid repairs that won’t bring a high return on investment.&nbsp;

* **Get an accurate valuation of your home.** Zillow’s Zestimate feature can provide a ballpark range of what your home might be worth, but it isn’t accurate enough for you to base your list price off of it. Instead, consult with an experienced Realtor and request a comparative market analysis. This will be the best way to determine your home’s value. Even appraisals, which offer a snapshot of your property’s current value, don’t take the momentum of the market into account. You need a professional real estate agent’s guidance. Speaking of which…
* **Hire a professional agent**. Having an experienced real estate professional by your side will make a world of difference in the success of your deal. Their knowledge will be your greatest resource. It’s never too early to seek out and hire an agent if you’re thinking of selling.
