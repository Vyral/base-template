There is certainly a time and a place for renting, but if you’re paying $1,200 or more per month, why not consider homeownership? **Wouldn’t it be better to apply that monthly expense toward your own wealth, rather than lining your landlord’s pockets?**

I recently received a referral for a woman who was sick and tired of the rental lifestyle. She had had enough of rental rates going up year after year, and was ready to make the jump into homeownership.

Not long after we got in touch, she was able to get pre-approved. And to make a long story short, she’s now set up to move into a new construction home in a brand-new subdivision.

As a homeowner, she’ll start building equity in her home right away. On top of that, she’ll also benefit from appreciation and tax write-offs.

So if you’re in a scenario like this yourself, now is the time to start considering homeownership. Homeownership is easier than most think. And **there are many different programs than can make it even simpler, as well as more affordable.** You don’t need to be afraid of homeownership.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
