What’s happening in our local Ventura County market? Are we in a buyer’s or a seller’s market? I’ll answer those questions for you today.&nbsp;

**Right now we are definitely in seller’s market,** which means it’s a fantastic time to sell your home. Our inventory levels in Ventura County are extremely low—less than two months of supply on the market. That means if there were no new homes listed, it would only take two months to sell all the inventory.

**S****\*\*elle**rs are enjoying low competition and high buyer activity thanks to low inventory.\*\*As long as your home is priced correctly, you’re going to get really strong offers. You’ll probably even see multiple offers and offers above list price.

So what does this mean for buyers shopping in a seller’s market?

With inventory so low, buyers are having to make some compromises like shopping in a different price range, considering other locations, or giving up certain amenities. Offers need to be as strong as possible, often above list price.

However, there is some good news for buyers. Interest rates are still low at just above 4%. **You can still lock in a great rate that will save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.**

<br>If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home or if you have any other real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
