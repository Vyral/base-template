Because Zillow estimates the price of a home, it’s often used as a tool by both homebuyers and home sellers. However, users may not understand how the website’s Zestimate is calculated and find faith in a number that could be, in reality, too high or too low.

This is how it’s calculated:

Zillow computes a price from an algorithm, which is based predominantly on past tax records. **Because these records aren’t current, it does not show an accurate representation of a home’s current price.**

A Zestimate does not have all of the information, such as data from our MLS or prices from homes sold by builders. Without these, the Zestimate is not a true reflection of property value.

To find an accurate number, it’s a good idea to call a real estate agent. **We’re able to pull numbers from tax rolls, builders, our MLS, and nearby homes that have sold.** An agent can also compare the condition of a sold home to yours—something that Zillow is unable to do.

There is no way for Zillow to be truly accurate. The website even tells you their prices are **at least** 5% to 6% off.
