Can you believe another school year has begun? While back-to-school time may leave parents breathing a sigh of relief, it means something very different for all the teachers out there. **Educating the next generation is no easy task, so our team decided that now is the perfect time to show our appreciation.**

To demonstrate our gratitude, we’ve put together a teacher’s survival basket. We hope the supplies in this kit will help a deserving educator make an easy transition back into the classroom. But we need your help selecting someone who deserves it.

You can nominate one of the great teachers in your life by liking our Facebook page, then commenting their name on our wall. We’ll announce the winning nominee on September 1 at 10 a.m., so don’t delay in sending us your pick.

And it gets even better. **If your nominee was selected, you’ll accompany me on the Monday after we announced our winner (September 3)  to surprise them with the basket.**

We’re so excited to make the day of one educator a little brighter, so please help us make it happen by sending in your nomination and sharing this video with family and friends.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please feel free to give my team or me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
