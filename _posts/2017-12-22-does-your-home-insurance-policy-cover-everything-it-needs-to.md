There are a lot of commercial advertisements for different home insurance companies out there, and these advertisements can get repetitive to the point where you might assume that when they promise you “peace of mind,” they mean they will cover everything. Is that true?

These are just advertisements, so **not everything they say is true.** The best way to know for sure is to dive into your policy. One of the reasons I wanted to address this topic today is because of the recent wildfires Southern California’s been experiencing. So many insurance claims have been racked up due to these wildfires, and they can get expensive, especially with recent supply and demand and home values increasing.

This is why you need to **make sure your policy is up to date.** A couple years ago, your home may have been covered up to a certain dollar amount, but that may have changed without you even knowing about it. Make sure any damage that can be caused to your home is covered. If your neighbor’s home burned down but yours didn’t, your home can still be affected by the ash blowing onto your property. Is that cleanup covered? If you don’t understand your policy, odds are that it isn’t.

When an insurance company promises peace of mind, you need to make sure you understand the ins and outs of your policy. If it doesn’t cover certain natural disasters that can happen in your area, it may be time to switch companies. **Sit down with your agent and double-check if everything is up to date.**
