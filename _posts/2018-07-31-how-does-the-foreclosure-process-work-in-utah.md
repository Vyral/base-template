Today I want to talk a little bit about the foreclosure process and how it works here in the state of Utah. It’s a non-judicial system, which means that the courts do not initiate the foreclosure process. The lender does, and they see it through from beginning to end.

**Before the lender can officially start the process, they mail a notice of intent to file a notice of default.** That will include what contact for a loan modification may be to bring it current or any other foreclosure relief that the lender recommends. It gives you 30 days to bring that loan current, including any late fees and penalties, to avoid the next step: the notice of default.

**The notice of default is the official start of the foreclosure process and is administered by a third party on behalf of the lender.** They are called the trustee, and will record the notice of default with the county recorder’s office at least three months prior to issuing the notice of sale. The trustee mails the copy of the notice of default to the borrower within 10 days of it being recorded.

**The next step is the notice of sale**. The lender or trustee will mail a copy to the borrower at least 20 days before the sale. It also gets published in the newspaper, as well as a physical piece of paper on the property itself.

If, for some reason, you start missing some payments on your house, here are some things you need to do:

**1. Be proactive.** A lender does not want to foreclose on your property. It’s very expensive for them and they would rather work out another solution for you. They need your involvement though, so you need to be very proactive. If you’re behind on your payments for whatever reason, there are alternatives to foreclosure. It’s the last thing you want to happen. It all starts with communication.

**2. Get qualified help.** You don’t need to go through this alone and you should never pay for assistance unless you’re dealing with a licensed attorney to walk you through the process.

**3. Get educated.** There are tons of resources readily available to you to help you better understand your options and help you make better-educated decisions. How quickly you recover from this has a lot to do with the actions and steps you take today.

**4. Connect with us.** We’d love the opportunity to help you out. We’ve been able to help many clients do this in the past, and we’d be happy to offer you a free, no-obligation consultation to let you know what your options are.
