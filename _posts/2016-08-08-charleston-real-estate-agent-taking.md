Are you sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether now is the time to sell your Charleston home? I have four compelling reasons why you should:

1. **Low inventory, high demand.** Not only do we have the people living in Charleston looking to purchase a home, but 70% of the people inquiring on our websites right now are folks living outside the area intending to move here soon. A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!

2. **An influx of millennials purchasing.** We refer to this as “pent-up demand.” These are people who are now old enough to purchase a home after living with their parents or renting for longer than they wanted due to the previous recession. Their collective need to buy homes has caused the market to continue to boom.

3. **Home values are up.** Did you know that we’re in a 9% higher price point than we were a year ago? If you couldn’t previously sell your home, you may now be able to.

4. **Interest rates are at an all-time low.** If interest rates go up 1%, that cuts a buyer’s purchasing power by 10%. This means that if you own a home that’s worth $300,000 and interest rates rise by 1%, a potential buyer for that house that could’ve gotten approved at $300,000 can now only get approved for $270,000.

If you’re interested in finding out exactly what your home will sell for for in today’s market, click on the links above or reply to this email specifically. If all else fails, just give me a call. I look forward to talking to you soon.
