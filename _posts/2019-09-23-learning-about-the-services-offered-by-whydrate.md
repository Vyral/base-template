Jordan Griffith started his company wHydrate here in the area on October 1, 2018. They now have two locations after joining forces with another clinic off Chastain Road down in Kennesaw.&nbsp;

wHydrate is an IV hydration clinic, where people go to vitamins, minerals, and nutrients delivered into their bodies via intravenous delivery. This method bypasses the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which allows those nutrients to be absorbed more efficiently.&nbsp;

**To learn more about wHydrate and how their services work, refer to the video above or feel free to use the timestamps below to navigate the conversation at your leisure:**

I highly encourage everyone to check out their website and/or visit one of wHydrate’s locations in the Town Lake area.
