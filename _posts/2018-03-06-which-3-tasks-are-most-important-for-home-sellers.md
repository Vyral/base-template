Today I’m going to share the top three things you need to do to prepare your home for sale in 2018. Let’s jump right in.

**1. Have a consultation with one of our listing specialists.** They will come over and meet you at your home, walk through a little bit of the process, and give you an estimate of what you can sell your home for and what your profit will be. They can also help you determine what the next steps are. We provide this to you for free.

**2. Begin preparing the home for sale.** You don’t have to do it all now or all in one weekend, but start putting away things that you don’t need. Start decluttering, cleaning, and double checking your light bulbs, your yard, and every other detail of your home.

**3. Have a professional photographer.** That’s one of the most important members on our team. We give all of our clients a free certificate for a free photography shoot whenever they are ready. We can then take those pictures to all of our relocation buyers and they can use it as a tool to determine whether or not they want to come and see your home. You bring the house, we’ll bring the marketing and photography, and we’ll marry it for an absolutely perfect real estate transaction.

I would love and be honored to help you with the sale of your home. If you have any questions for me or need my help in any way, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
