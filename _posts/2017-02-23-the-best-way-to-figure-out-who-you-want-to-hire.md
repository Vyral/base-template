How do you define the profile of a person you are looking to hire?

Defining the type of person you want to hire may seem difficult to do. However, whenever we ask someone who they don’t want to hire, the answer comes very easily to them.

So, if you are really struggling to figure out how you want to hire, we recommend that you sit down and figure out who you don’t want to hire first. Think about the skills that you don’t need the candidate to have or personality traits that won’t align with your core values.

**After you figure that out, you should be able to have some clarity on who you want to hire.** Once that clarity hits, you need to write down your do’s and don’ts for the ideal candidate. Then, you need to highlight the top three qualities that your ideal candidate would have.

Those three qualities are non-negotiable. No candidate is perfect. Just make sure that your candidate matches with your top three, non-negotiable qualities. Those qualities should fit into where you see your company going in the future. You need to make sure that the candidate can grow with your organization, both through their role and through the culture of the company.

I hope this helps you define the right type of person that you want to hire. If you need any help in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!
