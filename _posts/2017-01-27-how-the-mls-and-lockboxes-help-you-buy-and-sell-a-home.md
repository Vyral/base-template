{% include youtube.html %}Lately, I've had a lot of buyers wondering how I'm able to show them homes that I don't personally have listed. If my picture isn't on the 'for sale' sign, how can I show the home?

When a homeowner decides to sell their home with the help of an agent, they're working with a listing agent. The listing agent puts the home on a service called the MLS (multiple listing service), which basically advertises that home to every agent who has access to the MLS. Why would you want your home advertised to these agents, though? When a home is put on the market, there's a certain commission that's agreed upon by the seller to pay the listing agent and the agent who brings them a willing buyer. The agent who brings a buyer is known as a buyer's agent.

The Realtor who shows the home represents the buyer's side of the transaction, whereas the listing agent represents the seller's side of the transaction. Every agent who has access to the MLS also has access to a lockbox, which they can log into for access to the keys to the home. Every time a buyer's agent logs into a lockbox, their ID and license verification get sent to the seller to notify them who is looking at their home and how much traffic is coming in.

This will give sellers an idea of whether their home is priced right and attractive to buyers. So that's how we're able to show homes to our clients that aren't our listings.

I hope this helps you understand the MLS and how showings work, no matter who the listing agent is. If you have any other questions or you're looking to buy or sell a Sacramento home, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to help you!
