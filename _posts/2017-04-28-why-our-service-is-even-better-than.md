When it comes to our service, we list a wide variety of price ranges and charge competitively with 95% of the other agents in our area.

Today I want to answer a couple frequently asked questions about our service.

The first has to do with the price ranges of the houses we sell. We’re known for marketing and selling homes in the higher price ranges, but **we list a wide variety of price ranges.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

We’ll list homes from $80,000 to $90,000 all the way up to $1 million or more. Our home selling system is proven, duplicatable, and backed by market research so it can be applied to all price ranges.

The second question has to do with how much our service costs. A lot of people assume that because we do so much marketing and sell so many houses, we automatically charge a high percentage rate. That’s not true — **our rate is very competitive.** In fact, it’s the same rate you would get with 95% of the other agents in the area. Rates are not set by law—they’re negotiable and set by the companies. There is no extra charge to get the Lance Woodley Team on your side.

If you or someone you know has a home to sell, give us a call today. We’re ready to sell your home.
