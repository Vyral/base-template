I recently had a conversation with one of my clients about can’t ask salary laws which made me realize that many of you might not be aware of how they work.

**A few areas across the country have recently passed can’t ask salary laws.** Like any new law, it can be a little complicated, so let me simplify it for you.

Three states and one city have these laws in effect: California, Massachusetts, Delaware, and New York City. Oregon has passed a can’t ask salary law that will go into effect in January of 2019. Philadelphia also passed a can’t ask salary law, but that has been delayed due to some court actions.

**Basically, the law prevents you from asking potential candidates applying for a position about their previous or current salary.** When I say salary, that encompasses the entire compensation package. You are allowed to ask what their salary expectations are if they were to make a move or accept a position within your organization.

Now remember, this is not just for companies headquartered in that state; if you are filling any positions for your company within that state, these laws apply.

Can’t ask salary laws are all-encompassing for companies and agencies.

If you do not follow these laws, you will get sued.
