In April of 2017, the Ontario government imposed a tax on foreign real estate buyers. The goal of this tax was to slow down the frantic pace of real estate sales in the Toronto area.

While sales did slow down and prices dropped around 15% to 20% on average in the greater Toronto area (GTA), it’s not fully clear at this point whether foreign investors or buyers were the cause of the runaway prices we saw earlier in the year, as was the case in Vancouver.

What do Toronto home prices look like this fall? **They’re not where they were in the spring, but they’re edging upward once more.** Despite these fluctuations, many of my clients would still like to make a move in our market. One of the questions I often get from them is, “What’s the market like? Is it a buyer’s market or a seller’s market now toward the end of 2017?”

When looking at the number of homes listed for sale versus the number of actual sales, **we have a balanced market**, which is two months of inventory in the GTA. However, market conditions vary considerably in various neighborhoods compared to the GTA, especially in downtown Toronto.

That’s why it would be a mistake to come to any conclusion as to the value of your home without talking to an expert in your area. If you have any more questions about the current state of our Toronto market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you.
