Today we want to talk a little bit about our team, our process, and how everything works when we are helping a homebuyer or seller with their transaction. Dana is a new member to our team and has really brought a unique touch. Recently, we discussed this topic and &nbsp;now we want to share our conversation with you.

**I started the Elite Home Team around two years ago because I believed that a team concept would bring much better service to my clients.**

We put a lot into our transactions, whether we are working with a buyer or a seller. Dana works exclusively with buyers, and I with sellers. When you hire one of us, you are getting an entire team helping you with the process instead of just one person. We have a team of 10, including other agents, administrative staff, and a sales department that makes 10,000 calls per week.

It is really hard for a single agent to keep up with a process like this. **Everybody on our team specializes in doing what they do best, and things work better for everyone that way.**

If you have any questions for us or want to put our team to work to help you buy or sell your next home, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
