In the second episode of Level Up with Rosie Hayer, we share the virtual space with Paul Campanaro, the team leader of Keller Williams Northwest Market Center, and talk about how leaders rise to the occasion. Here, we identify the questions that a pandemic-proof leader should ask as we power through one of the world’s most challenging crises.&nbsp;

#### How should we approach the challenge?

Paul strikes us with a powerful insight when he was asked about how he leads during a pandemic. He emphasizes that even though we set the biggest goals, we cannot avoid the systems that mold our undertakings. With a massive disruption in sight, it is important to build teams that will run as a unit. Leading during a crisis is not entirely about knowing what exactly we should do now. It’s about finding the right people with the right ideas and realizing the power of synergies that can make change happen.

#### What new discoveries can we take away from this predicament?

The pandemic gave birth to problem-solvers. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention as Paul pointed out. As leaders, it is our rightful duty to lay the groundwork and encourage our team to move forward. *Where were we?* *Where are we now?* *Where are we going?* These are the questions we should ask to help us understand the situation and find the right resources to rise from the challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### How can we bounce back from this collective fear?

The world is not a stranger to crises, but the key differentiators that drove how each situation turned out are the decisions we make. These choices are grounded on our habits, values, and our level of self-awareness. An effective leader, despite the noise, fear, and discouragement, is able to find his center. With all the information we consume every day, succumbing to that collective fear is unavoidable. So one must be eager to connect, understand, and keep a clear mind to lead the pack.

#### How can we learn from the past?

The short answer: prepare for the worst. Paul gives us a reality check and reminds us that things might get ugly, especially that the shift we’re facing now is too drastic and abrupt. We were not given ample time to adjust and prepare, and despite being an expert on everything, we’re still not able to decode it. As we’ve learned from the past, a great leader knows what matters to him the most. It is this clarity that will help him face the adversity and remind him of his purpose when the going gets tough.&nbsp;

The pandemic has shown how every industry can easily fall to its knees. Moreover, it revealed the best and the worst of our leaders. As we live through it day by day, we’ll continue to witness what makes a great leader, how their choices can affect ours, and how successful leaders can help us emerge as new beings in the new society we’re building.
