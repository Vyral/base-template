There are many reasons why rental properties are a popular and profitable investment vehicle in real estate. **Here are the three most important:**

**1\. Prices go up.** On average, the appreciation of a home is between 3% and 5% per year. Over a long-term period, that means a lot of profit.

**2\. Rent goes up.** Rent is usually tied to inflation, and it typically goes up between 2% and 4% per year. You could buy a rental property today and charge $1,000 for rent now, and be able to charge $1,500 in five to 10 years.

**3\. The rent pays down the mortgage.** Every year, your mortgage goes down and that becomes equity. Therefore, you end up with a paid-off property.

Owning rental properties is a fantastic investment. You just have to choose the right properties and manage them the right way. There are numerous other benefits that we didn’t even cover today.
