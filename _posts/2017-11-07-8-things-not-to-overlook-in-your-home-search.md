Today, we’d like to go over eight things to never overlook when buying a home:

**1. The neighborhood**. I recommend driving through the neighborhood at different periods of day. Check things out after school has let out, at night, and during the day. Also, try to look at the overall pride of the community.&nbsp;

**2. Your new commute**. Looking at houses on a Saturday afternoon will be an entirely different experience than navigating the neighborhood after coming home from work in the evening. What will your commute look like? How will traffic affect it? Make sure you can actually handle your new commute before you move.&nbsp;

**3. Covenants, codes, and restrictions**. If you’re buying a home within a homeowners association or something similar, pay attention to any rules that might be in place. Take some time to familiarize yourself with these covenants, codes, and restrictions, to make sure they won’t interfere with your lifestyle.&nbsp;

**4. Bedroom-to-bathroom ratio**. If you’re looking at a home with five bedrooms and just one bathroom, issues may arise. This is especially the case if you have a large family, so keep this ratio in mind as you look at homes.

**5. Need for speciality inspections**. You’re always going to need a home inspection. But, specialty inspections may be property-specific. This includes well inspections, septic inspections, chimney inspections, and many more.&nbsp;

**6. Features that can’t be changed**. Before you decide on a certain property, think about whether you’re happy with the features that can’t be changed. The No. 1 example of this is location. Another feature you won’t be able to change is the lot size. There are also some changes that can technically be made, but would be very expensive. You can change the floorplan, for example, but it’s much easier to start with something you like than to fix it down the line.&nbsp;

**7. Resale value**. No one can definitively predict this factor, but there are a few ways you can boost your chances of a high resale value. The biggest determinant of resale value is the school system. Whether you have children or not, buyers who do will care about the schools near you. Additionally, areas with good schools usually tend to maintain value, overall.

**8. Room to grow**. This last point may not apply to some. However, those who are planning on raising a family in the future should make sure they are taking the amount of space they’ll have into consideration.&nbsp;
