I know that I spend most of my time updating you about our current markets and different ways to prepare your house. However, today I want to share something even more exciting.

I want to share the jingle that Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts recorded for us at the Moving On Team. Rascal Flatts had a number one song years ago called “I'm Moving On” and we have been able to incorporate it into some of our marketing.

The clip starts at 1:05 above. **Let us know what you think!**
