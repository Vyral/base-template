<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Meet the newest member of the Stary Group, Dave Coppes.</em></p>

Today I’m proud to introduce you to one of our new buyer specialists, Dave Coppes. He’s done an amazing job with his clients in the 10 or so months that he’s been with the Stary Group, but if you haven’t worked with him yet, this is your chance to get to know him a little and to learn what value he brings to his clients.

At home, Dave enjoys married life, and his wife is expecting their first child this May. He also has two awesome rescue bulldogs at home.

According to Dave, **joining our team has been one of the best decisions he ever made.** He has a passion for helping people, and as a buyer specialist, that’s exactly what he gets to do. By getting to the heart of his clients’ needs, he can focus on the exact type of home that fits their criteria. Last year, Dave had the pleasure of helping 22 families, and he looks forward to helping even more people this year.

Dave always puts others before himself, which is a defining feature that translates into a better overall experience for his clients. That’s huge in our business—the homes he helps clients to buy are going to help make memories that last a lifetime. I know that Dave will continue to do amazing things for the team and his clients in the years to come.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy or sell a house this year, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re always here to help you through the process.
