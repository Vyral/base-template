I’m coming to you today from the beautiful Canadian Rockies. I’m excited to be up here with a great group of people.

As you may know, part of my personal mission statement is that **the most difficult tasks yield the most valuable lessons.** As we’ve been hiking across difficult terrain, I’ve learned a great lesson that I want to share with all of you.

I spent the last several months planning a very specific route for this trip. The day before we left, I got an email from the national park saying that the trail I’d planned to go on was closed.

I had dedicated a lot of time to planning the route, getting camping permits, and studying the trail. Everything was ready and suddenly, I had to come up with a new plan in less than 24 hours.

We went to the source, asked a few questions, and got a map. I put together a few key places that we wanted to go. Then, we figured out where we were going to start and where we were going to end up, which are the two most critical points in any journey.

Once I had a clear idea of our destination, I broke the trip down into smaller benchmarks. I studied all of the landmarks I would need to know to reach the first benchmark. I knew exactly what I was looking for, so I was able to put the map away.

Once we got to that first benchmark, we verified that it was where we were supposed to be and looked ahead to the second benchmark.

**Benchmarks can also apply to your business and personal goals.**

I get to rub shoulders with some of the most phenomenal people in the world, and we’re constantly talking about our end goals but we don’t talk about the next benchmark we need to hit to get there.

My challenge for you today is to figure out what your next benchmark is on your way to success. Once you hit that benchmark, celebrate your progress! Then, figure out where you need to be next in order to stay on track to achieve your goal.

Of course, your ultimate goal is still important, but that path is all built on benchmarks.

If you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can do to help you with your business, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
