As you’ve probably heard by now, the government has passed sweeping legislation to dramatically change our tax code. A lot of things are going to change.

**Before I get started, let me just remind you that if you need individualized tax advice, you should consult your CPA**. However, I do want to provide you with some helpful information about how the changes could affect your mortgage and other payments.

The main driver in the changes is that the standard deduction has been increased up to $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a couple. This is important because it will encourage more people to claim the standard deduction as opposed to itemizing those deductions. **There are three big negatives and one positive that we’ve identified as it relates to real estate and real estate finance**. The negatives are:

**1. Mortgage interest deduction**. Previously, you could write up the mortgage interest on a loan up to $1 million. That number has been lowered to $750,000. While that’s still a very large number, this change will undoubtedly affect some people at the upper end of the market.

**2. Equity indebtedness**. If you’ve taken cash out of your property at some point in the past, there were all these complicated rules about what can be written off and what can’t. Starting in 2018, none of the interest on the equity piece of your loan is going to allow it to be written off. If this is something that might affect you, I would definitely discuss it with your CPA.

**3. The property tax exemption**. You’re only going to be allowed to write off up to $10,000 on your property taxes. Although that might sound like a large number, especially in the DFW area, it’s not the largest property assessed value that affects you. Keep that in mind.

On the positive side of things, the capital gains exclusion is still in place. You can write off up to $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a property if you’re single, and you can write off up to $500,000 as a couple. These terms didn’t change with the new bill. I know a lot of real estate investors who have greatly benefitted from this exclusion.

If you have any concerns about the new tax bill and how it will affect you or if you’re planning on buying a home in 2018, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call. We would be happy to help answer any questions you may have.
