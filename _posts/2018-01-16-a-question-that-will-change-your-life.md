Happy 2018! You’ve all asked me some great questions this last year, and today, I’m utilizing this time to pose a question that has had a huge impact on my life. I hope it has the same effect on yours.

This is a very personal story.&nbsp; **About three or four years ago, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called ITP**. I’ve been fine for the last three years; I’ve not dealt with it since then. But for a couple years of my life, I’ve dealt with being on prednisone and going through chemotherapy. It was a really hard time and I’ll never forget it.

Maybe you’ve been through chemotherapy yourself or have had a friend or family member who has. It’s a very challenging time. Once a week for eight weeks, I would go in and get dripped, be hooked up, and they would have everything going through my body. One of the first times I went, I was parked in the lot, and I realized that I was going to go in and have this drug dripped into my body. I knew there would be potential side effects.

**I began to realize that life is very precious and that I may not be around tomorrow.**

When I was faced with that reality, it really made me contemplate what I was doing in my life and what I would do differently if I knew that I wasn’t going to be around for very long.

One of my business coaches actually planted this question and it really stuck with me: “**Dave, what would you do differently in your life if you knew you couldn’t fail?**”<br><br>In that moment, I realized a lot of the things that I wanted to do in my business weren’t being done because I was afraid.

I wanted to throw this question out to you to carry throughout 2018. What would you do differently in your life if you knew you couldn’t fail? Maybe it’s something personal. Maybe you would adopt, but you’re afraid of something. Maybe it has to do with your dating life, your marriage, your business, or something else.
