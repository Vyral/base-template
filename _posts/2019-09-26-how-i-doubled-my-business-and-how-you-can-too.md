I got into the real estate industry in 2012. I sold about $3 million in my first year, $11 million in my second year, $24 million in my third year, and then $33 million for two years, $37 million the year after that, and $51 million last year.

That’s a total of about $200 million. I think that if I started doing one simple thing early on, I would be at around $400 million. **That one thing is coaching.**

I’m talking about fully committed coaching, learning about my business, learning from others businesses, and paying people to tell me about it. When I started significant coaching about three years ago, it was a lot and I was initially second-guessing the amount of money I was spending.

**However, the coaching I received made me accountable, made me see things I hadn’t before, and made me open up to lots of different ideas.** That kind of coaching lasted a couple of years, and then I moved on to more of a “mindset” coach. This coach really opened my eyes to what is possible in the industry.

The mindset of building something sustainable without having to work all the time was something that I needed. I learned what I need to do to ensure I was caring for myself while also giving my clients the best possible service.

My third and current coach is more focused on building out my systems and processes to make my team the best is possibly can be for my clients. That’s what I’ve been working on.

There are a lot of coaches out there that aren’t super expensive. **If you’re just getting into the business, you don’t need a systems and process coach, you need a lead generation or mindset type of coach.&nbsp;**

One of the most important things you want to make sure of is that you’re a good fit with your coach too both personality- and communication-wise.

**Finally, you have to be coachable to do well with coaching.** If someone says something to you and you can go ahead and do it, that’s going to help you out a lot. Stubbornness or pride will not.

If you have any questions for me or want some recommendations on a coach that would work best for you, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
