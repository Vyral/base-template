Here are three questions very important questions to ask yourself:

Who are you? What do you want? What are you willing to do to get what you want?

\{% include pullquote.html %

**A great place to start is to find clarity on who we are**, whether that be in our business life, in our relationships, in our spiritual journey, in our physical care, and our finances. Once we understand who we are, we must determine what we want. What do you want in your relationships? What do you want out of your business? What type of physical well-being do you want? These are spaces we occupy everyday, and it's important to know who we are and what we want out of it. Now we have to determine what we are willing to do to get what we want. To what level will you go to ensure you get everything you want in each of those parts of your life? **This is a good time to clarify what you're not willing to do.**

For example, if lead generation is something that I have to do, and I'm willing to do it, but door-knocking isnâ€™t my thing, I'm not going to entertain that. I know that the probability of me doing it well is low. Although, making 100 calls every day, talking to 30 people, and having a real estate conversation is something I'm willing to do each and every day.

If you have any questions or want to talk about this further, please call, text, or email us. We'd love to set up some time to speak with you.
