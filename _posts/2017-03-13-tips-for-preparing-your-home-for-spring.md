With spring right around the corner, I thought today would be a good time to give you some tips on how to prepare your home to sell in the spring market.

First, you need to **neutralize and depersonalize your space as much as you can.** Buyers want to be able to walk into a house and visualize themselves there, which means it’s time to start decluttering and stowing away items you don’t need either in the garage or in a storage unit. You don’t need to take down every personal photo, but toning down the personal items is a must.

Next, now is a good time to **replace any flooring or touch up any areas that need new paint.** A fresh coat of paint goes a long way in making your home feel move-in ready. Remember to stick with neutral paint colors!

You also need to to make sure you **clean up the outside of your home.** The outside is going to give off the first impression, which means you need to cut back the shrubs and put away any lawn decorations.

It would also be a good idea to power wash your exterior and give your front door a fresh coat of paint!

If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help!
