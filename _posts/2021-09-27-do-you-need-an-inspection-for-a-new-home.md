**I often get asked whether you should get an inspection done on a new construction home.** I think that you definitely should whether the home is existing or brand-new. Our inspector just finished looking at a new construction home in Hampton Mill on John’s Island. They found one leak and a few minor things that the builder will address. Take a look at this beautiful home at 0:55 in the video that shows even great homebuilders can make mistakes.

If you have any questions or want a recommendation for a great inspector, don’t hesitate to reach out to me and my team. We’d love to hear from you and help in any way we can.
