As we transition from 2021 to 2022, the market is expected to shift slightly. Today I’ll talk about what's going to be different.&nbsp;

Rates are still very low now, but economists are projecting that they will increase by 0.5% to 1% next year. By the end of 2022, rates might be around 4%. That means you'll qualify for much less in 2022.

**&nbsp;If you're looking to buy a home in 2022, buy at the beginning of the year because your payment would start to increase as rates rise, and you'll have a lot less competition.** As rates increase, there will be much less competition for buyers because they won’t be able to qualify for as high of a loan. Instead of 30 offers on every single property, you’ll probably see a maximum of 10 to 15.

If you're looking to buy or sell a home and you want more information on the market, feel free to call, email, or text me. Don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel. I look forward to hearing from you.
