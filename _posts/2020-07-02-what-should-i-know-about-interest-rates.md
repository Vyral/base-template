Interest rates affect real estate immensely. Find out how here.

If you’re interested in real estate, it’s always vital to know about interest rate**s. This April saw historically low interest rates at approximately 3.5%.** When I bought my first home about 40 years ago, I paid roughly an 11% interest rate.&nbsp;

Let’s say a house costs $430,000 with a 3.5% interest rate; your payment would be $1,931 per month, not including taxes or insurance. Last year, interest rates were right around 4.5%, a full percentage point higher than now. The payment for that same house with a 4.5% interest rate would be $2,179— $248 more per month than the lower interest rate, which is almost $3,000 more per year. Compared to a year ago, this gives buyers $50,000 more in buying power.

**This is the power of interest rates.** One of my mortgage partners has interest rates on some loans as low as 2.5% on a 30-year fixed\! Interest rates fluctuate daily, but these days they’ve been great.&nbsp;

If you want to know more about interest rates or are considering buying or refinancing, let’s talk. Give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to speak with you.
