Wondering how long it will take to sell your home this summer? According to Redfin, the average home takes about 32 days on the market to sell. However, this number is just an average; in reality, some homes sell almost instantly, while others stagnate on the market for months. Why is this? In my opinion, it comes down to three key factors: Condition, accessibility, and pricing. Today, I’m going to break down each of these factors and explain how you can leverage them to sell your home faster:

**1\. Condition.** You can’t control your location, but you can upgrade your home’s condition before you hit the market. Make sure you take care of any minor repairs upfront. You may even want your agent to do a walkthrough of your home and point out anything that might worry buyers. Small things might not seem like a big deal, but they leave an impression on your buyers that your home might not be in good shape. Plus, buyers don’t have a ton of spare cash due to high prices and interest rates. If they don’t have to pay for repairs themselves, they’ll be more likely to put in an offer fast.

**2\. Accessibility.** Buyers can’t put an offer on a home they can’t see. Being as accessible to buyers as possible will increase your showings and net you better offers faster. I understand it isn’t always possible to leave the house on short notice, being flexible and having a plan in place can make the process smoother. Set clear expectations with your agent for how you want them to manage showings. Also, be prepared to accommodate potential buyers to maximize your chances of a successful sale.

**3\. Pricing.** Your initial price is more than just a number; it’s the first part of your marketing strategy. Work with your agent to find similar homes in your area that have sold recently to find a good starting point. From there, choose a reasonable starting price to draw attention, create competition, and start a bidding war. This will help your house sell quickly and naturally increase the price to wherever the market is at.

Hopefully, these tips will help you sell your home quickly. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call me for a free home-selling consultation. I’ll go over the details of your home with you and share what you can do to move fast. I look forward to hearing from you!
