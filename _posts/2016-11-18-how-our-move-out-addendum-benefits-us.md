For every home we lease, we have the tenant sign a move out addendum. This ensures that the property is left in good condition for the next tenant.

Today we wanted to talk about an important part of our leasing contract: The Move Out Addendum. You see, every tenant that signs with us signs a move out addendum.

**This contract is an agreement that the tenant will leave the property in the same condition that they got it**, specifically with regard to ensuring that the carpet and the interior are professionally cleaned, because this is the service that we offer to them. This addendum also guarantees us in writing that if the tenant has a pet, they will get special pet treatment on their carpets and deodorize the entire home so that there is no residue.

**In addition, this addendum gives the tenant the option of allowing us to professionally clean the home if they don’t want to do it themselves.** That way, they don’t have to clean the house twice. If our tenant does choose to do their own professional cleaning and we get the receipt that things aren’t finished, however, we have the right to recall the service company, specify what they didn’t finish, and make sure the job gets done.

Remember, we only work with two goals in mind: 1) to protect your home; 2) to put money into your account.

If you have any questions about our move out addendum or anything else related to property management, please feel free to call us or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
