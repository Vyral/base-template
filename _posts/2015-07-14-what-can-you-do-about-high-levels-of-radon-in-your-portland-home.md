{% include youtube.html %}Not many homeowners are aware of the potential dangers of radon gas. Today, we want to give you some basic information so you can keep your home and your family safe from this toxic gas!

Many home inspections that are done today test for radon gas. It's an odorless, invisible, radioactive gas that's produced from the natural decay of uranium and is found in most soil. Exposure to radon is responsible for up to 20,000 deaths in the United States each year and is the number one cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers.

It's estimated that one in every four homes in Portland accumulates levels of radon gas that are above what's acceptable according to the EPA. It's mostly found in homes with basements, but is sometimes found in homes above ground. A good way to determine whether your area is susceptible to high levels of radon is to get on Google and search your part of town. There are many resources on the web to find more information about radon.

What happens if you learn that your home has high levels of radon? Luckily, it's not the end of the world if radon is discovered in your home. We'll install a radon reduction system that can reduce radon levels upwards of 99%. A soil suction system is used to draw radon from below your home and vented through pipes that release it into the atmosphere outside of your house. These systems typically cost anywhere from $1,800-$4,000 depending on how serious the problem is.
