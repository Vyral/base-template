Navigating the world of mortgages can be complex, but having an experienced professional by your side makes all the difference. Bryan Zeutonhorst can attest to this as he has been part of the mortgage industry since 2001, starting his career early and staying committed ever since.

After briefly exploring a different career path in banking and the Department of Corrections, he returned to the mortgage field 12 years ago and has been working with Envoy Mortgage for the past two and a half years. Here’s everything you need to know about Bryan and Envoy Mortgage:

**All about Envoy Mortgage.** [Envoy Mortgage](https://www.envoymortgage.com/ "https://www.envoymortgage.com/"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a national lender based out of Houston, Texas. In April 2022, Bryan brought Envoy to Iowa, opening the only branch in the state. While the company operates on a national scale, Bryan’s office in Pleasant Hill serves as a local hub, offering personalized mortgage services to residents. Envoy Mortgage provides a variety of lending products, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and bridge loans. In addition to serving Iowa, Bryan is licensed to work in Minnesota, North Dakota, Illinois, and Florida, allowing him to help clients in these states as well.

**The importance of asking questions.** Over the years, Bryan has worked with many clients and emphasizes the importance of asking questions during the mortgage process. Many people hesitate to ask what they perceive as “stupid” or “dumb” questions. However, Bryan reminds that there are no bad questions when it comes to something as important as a mortgage. If something is on your mind, it is worth asking.

He also encourages clients to do their research. In today’s digital age, online reviews and customer service ratings can provide valuable insights into a lender’s reputation. Bryan believes that understanding a lender’s track record and level of service is key when choosing a mortgage provider.

**The changing mortgage landscape.** The mortgage industry has evolved significantly, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With a shift to digital and virtual interactions, face-to-face communication became less common. However, Bryan believes that personal, in-person conversations are essential in establishing trust and comfort with clients.

Many mortgage professionals now rely on automated systems for interactions, but Bryan feels it’s important to engage in meaningful conversations before diving into the application process. He believes that understanding clients’ needs and walking them through the process ensures a smoother experience and helps them feel more comfortable.
