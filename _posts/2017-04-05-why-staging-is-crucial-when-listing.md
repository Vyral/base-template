What makes staging so important? The simple answer is that staged homes sell quicker and for more money. So, what can you do to make sure your home is staged and ready to be put on the market?

Inside, you want to make sure you **depersonalize and edit your home to appeal to a wide variety and large number of buyers.** Buyers really want an emotional connection to a home, which they can achieve if it’s easy to picture their things in your home. You want to make sure your home is clean, functional, and above all, welcoming.

In the kitchen, you need to declutter. Get rid of dated accessories and things you don't need and make sure you have nice, clean countertops

In the living areas, you need to declutter and get rid of extra furniture to make the room feel more inviting. Stage it nicely by adding a focal point on a coffee table. Felicity puts groups of three or five accessories of various heights, widths, and materials in a room to really make the area pop. She is a big fan of using sparkly accessories that catch the eye and help open up space.

You’ll also want to clear the clutter from the laundry room, clear off countertops, and put laundry away. If you have a pet, you should pack away pet toys and the pets themselves. Many people are allergic and some people find pet things off-putting. Get rid any unwanted smells and stains caused by your pets as well.

In the master bathroom, **you want to make it look as much like a spa as possible.** Clear off the countertops, add contemporary accessories, and maybe even put on some soothing spa music. Everything left out in the bathroom needs to be pristine, which means watered plants and clean towels. Also it’s a good idea to remove any bathmats or fuzzy toilet covers.

The outside of the home is just as important as the inside. After all, **your curb appeal is the first impression.** You’ll want to powerwash your siding, clean the windows, make sure the lawn is nicely mowed, plant flowers for a pop of color, powerwash the path, and check to see if the garage and front door could use a spruce. In the backyard, powerwash your patio area and consider getting some great patio furniture.
