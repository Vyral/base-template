It's not very often that, after 28 years as a local real estate professional, I come across cool new concepts that will be very helpful for our clients. However, in the past few weeks I have come across a few very helpful tools to have the burden of property tax removed.

One of our clients has a father who has some needs in the world of modifying his existing mortgage. I put him in touch with a local senior loan mortgage expert, and he proved to be incredibly helpful. Not only did this expert have great ideas about how to help this older man, he also shared that every county has a program for seniors dealing with property taxes.

In the example above, the client fit beautifully into the generous parameters of a great program. To qualify, you have to be 65 years or older, produce evidence of a certain income threshold, and have less than a certain threshold as far as assets are concerned. The great unfortunate nature of many senior's situations is they often don't have robust bank accounts when they reach those later years.

It's a pretty simple process to apply to see if your loved one can apply to have the property tax burden removed! This could help many seniors hold onto their homes much longer. If you have questions about the process, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, give me a call or shoot me an email. I'm always ready and willing to help!
