{% include youtube.html %}Hi again, everybody. We just wanted to reach out to you today to wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving. Today we have a short video to share with you of our time helping out at the Burbank Temporary Aid Center.

They have been serving the Burbank community for 40 years and we figured we should give them some extra help this holiday season. That is why we loaded up a van full of turkeys and took them over!

We help The Burbank Temporary Aid Center out year round, and you can too. They always need food, but those aren't the only services they offer for the less fortunate. They offer programs for many of the other basic necessities of life, including: Groceries, Lunches, assistance with utility bills, transportation services, limited medical assistance, shower facilities, and laundry facilities.

If you would like some more information about the Burbank Temporary Aid Center, check out their website here. If you have any other questions, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. Thanks, and have a happy Thanksgiving!
