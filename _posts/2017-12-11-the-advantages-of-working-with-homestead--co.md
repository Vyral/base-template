We started this real estate brokerage because we saw so many people being underserved by real estate agents. Most of the time it isn’t due to lack of effort, but because agents don’t understand exactly what they needed to deliver.

**No agent is excellent at every aspect of real estate.** Some are great at customer service, but don’t know how to bring in business. Others are great at bringing in business, but poor at customer service.

One of our goals in starting Homestead + CO was to create a culture that enhances the individual strengths of each of our team members and matches them together. We’ve succeeded in doing that, and we’re able to deliver a much higher level of customer service. By doing this, our agents have become more successful, too.

If you have any questions about our team or if it sounds like an environment you could thrive in as an agent, **I invite you to apply online at our career page [here](https://www.homesteadrealtyco.com/careers/).** If you have any other questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help.
