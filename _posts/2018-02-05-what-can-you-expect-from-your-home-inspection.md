If you’re a homebuyer in our area, it’s important that you get an inspection for the home you’re buying because most of the homes in our marketplace are older.

**Typically, you’ll have 17 days to check out the house and complete the inspection.**We have several great inspectors we’d be glad to refer you to if you’re in search of one.

Which inspection contingencies you’ll deal with depends on the property being inspected. A further roof inspection might be recommended, for example, or you might need to check out the property’s sewer line.

If the property has been remodeled recently, you can also have your Realtor pull the inspection permits to see what’s been done.
