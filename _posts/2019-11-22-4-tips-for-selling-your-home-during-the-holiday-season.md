Whether or not you *have* to sell during the holidays, here are a few things to consider when it comes to selling during this season:

**1\. There are more serious buyers in the market.** With everything else that they could be doing around this time of the year, people who shop for homes in November and December aren’t just looking for fun. They’re buying because they *need* to buy a home.

**2\. Don’t go overboard with your decorations.** It’s fine to decorate for the holidays, but keep them classy. Everyone has different preferences, religions, and tastes. If your home should remain on the market past the holidays, be sure to take those decorations down and have your home photography redone; you don’t want to age your listing by having Christmas photos up in the spring\!

**3\. Be careful with smells.** The holidays are a good excuse to make the most of seasonal scents, but like with decorations, be careful not to go overboard. I recommend going with a neutral scent or else baking cookies—that’s always a winner. Many people are sensitive to smells, and the wrong scent could turn them off to your home.

**4\. Have your home ready to sell.** Since there will be a huge influx of listings coming to the market in January, you’ll want to get your home ready to sell as soon as possible. This means that you should stage and photograph the property. If you can get your listing photos taken before you decorate for the holidays, all you’ll have to do is press ‘go’ when you’re ready to list. It’s ideal if you’re one of the first homes to hit the market, since other sellers will be crawling out of the woodwork.
