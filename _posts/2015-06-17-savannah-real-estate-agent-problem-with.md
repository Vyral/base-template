Hey there, I just wanted to take a second and say thanks for joining us on our blog. I wanted to talk for a few minutes today about new construction here in Savannah. Now that the real estate market is booming once again, we are seeing more and more new construction out there, pretty much anywhere you can think of in the area.

If you're looking at purchasing a new construction property, that's great. However, you should know that if you aren't represented by a Realtor, you are making yourself very vulnerable. While the builder's agent is credible, they are still looking out for the builder's best interest. You need a professional on your side to counteract this, and protect your best interests.

I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into new construction. If you have any questions about this or about any other topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to speaking with you!
