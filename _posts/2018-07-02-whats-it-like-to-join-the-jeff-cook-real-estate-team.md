We’ve got an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years, and now our team has an opportunity for you. **Whether you’re already a licensed agent or not, I’d like to talk to you about what joining our team could do for your life and career.**

We help our real estate agents be successful by providing marketing, leads, processes, presentations, back-end support staff, and more. So if you’re interested in getting paid what you deserve for your efforts and skills, and earning a six-figure income as a result, you’re going to want to hear more about what we’ve got to offer. But don’t take my word for it. Instead, **listen to what Christopher&nbsp;****Schiffiano** **(one of the amazing agents on our team) has to say.**

*“Before I came to Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was in the United States Army. After my term was up there, I went into real estate in the Florida market. When I decided to come home, where I was born and bred, Charleston, South Carolina, I joined the Jeff Cook Real Estate team.”*

*“In my first year of real estate, I sold 18 homes. My second year, I sold 20, and my goal continues to grow from that point. Working for Jeff Cook Real Estate over the years has changed my life in such a way where I can set personal goals and achieve them. A lot of times people get into real estate and they don't have a way of making goals because they’re too worried about getting their first deal, trying to find an office to work for. With Jeff Cook Real Estate, from day one, you start your success path.”*

*“My favorite part of working with Jeff Cook Real Estate is the comradery and the family environment. There is not a day that goes by that you can't walk into an office and see someone and they ask you about how all your kids are doing or how school is. There is definitely a family environment and I definitely&nbsp;**challenge you to compare this aspect to other big-box offices.**”*

*“People always say you have to spend money to make money, with Jeff Cook Real Estate, a lot of that pressure is taken off of you. There are times I’ve worked for other agencies where you had to generate your own business; you had to generate your own work. Being with Jeff, we are able to come in here and automatically start making money."*

*"Here at Jeff Cook Real Estate, we have many ways to get you to your success.”*

Now that you’ve had a look at Christopher’s success story, **I encourage you to visit [www.JoinJCRE.com](http://www.jeffcookrealestate.com/c/Join-JCRE/){: target="_blank"} to learn more about this opportunity** and set up an appointment.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
