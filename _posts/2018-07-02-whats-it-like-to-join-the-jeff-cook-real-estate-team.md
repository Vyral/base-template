We’ve got an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years, and now our team has an opportunity for you. **Whether you’re already a licensed agent or not, I’d like to talk to you about what joining our team could do for your life and career.**

We help our real estate agents be successful by providing marketing, leads, &nbsp;processes, presentations, back-end support staff, and more. So if you’re interested in getting paid what you deserve for your efforts and skills, and earning a six-figure income as a result, you’re going to want to hear more about what we’ve got to offer. But don’t take my word for it. Instead, **listen to what Christopher****Schiffiano** **(one of the amazing agents on our team) has to say.**

*“Before I came to Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was in the army. When my term was up there, I went into real estate in the Florida market. And when I decided to come home to where I was born and bred in Charleston, South Carolina, I joined the Jeff Cook Real Estate team.”*

*“In my first year of real estate, I sold 18 homes. In my second year, I sold 20. And my goal*

*continues to grow from there. Working for Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in such a way that I can set personal goals and achieve them. A lot of people don’t have ways of making goals, because they’re too worried about getting their first deal. But from day one working with Jeff Cook Real Estate, you start on your success path.”*

*“My favorite part of working with Jeff Cook Real Estate is the comradery and the family environment. **I challenge you to compare this aspect to other big-box offices.**”*

*“People always say you have to spend money to make money, but a lot of this pressure is taken off with Jeff Cook Real Estate. There are times I’ve worked for other agencies where you had to generate your own business. Being with Jeff, you can automatically come in and start making money. Here at Jeff Cook Real Estate, we have many ways to get you to your success.”*

Now that you’ve had a look at Christopher’s success story, **I encourage you to visit [www.JoinJCRE.com](http://www.jeffcookrealestate.com/c/Join-JCRE/){: target="_blank"} to learn more about this opportunity** and set up an appointment.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
