Have you heard the good news? We have a tremendous new VIP Buyer Program designed to reward buyers like you for choosing us to help you buy a home. Here’s what we’re offering.

You can earn a $1,500 closing credit if you buy a property from us that’s listed by us but isn’t yet on the MLS. This type of listing is sometimes referred to as a ‘pocket listing.’ This is a great opportunity for you to save money while buying a house that’s perfectly suited to your needs without any competition.

You can also earn a $1,000 closing credit if you buy one of our listings that’s actively listed on the MLS and a $500 closing credit if you buy any listing through us that’s not one of our listings but is still listed on the MLS.

As always, all of our buyers get their new houses re-keyed, because we’d never want you to move into a house without knowing who else has access to it.

In addition to these things, our VIP buyers also get to choose from one of four services:

* Free carpet cleaning.
* Four hours of moving help, which can be delegated and arranged according to your preferences.
* Four hours of housekeeping, from either the house you’re moving from or the house you’re moving to.
* Four hours of organizing help in your new home.

If you’re interested in this program, feel free to reach out to me so we can fill you in on all the details. Our goal this year is to help 100 families, and we’d love for you to be one of them!
