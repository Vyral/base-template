How can you buy a home with no money down? There are a few different options.

**First of all, if you are a veteran, you can get a VA loan.** Once you get the VA loan, your Realtor will negotiate for the seller to pay closing costs. If the seller pays all of the closing costs, you can buy the home without any money coming out of your pocket.

If you are not a veteran, there are two ways you can purchase a home with no money down:

1. Find a lender that can help you with an **FHA down payment assistance program.**

2. If you are buying in a rural area, you can apply for a **USDA loan**, which provides 100% financing.

Those are just a few ways to purchase a home with little to no money down.

If you have any other questions about buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
