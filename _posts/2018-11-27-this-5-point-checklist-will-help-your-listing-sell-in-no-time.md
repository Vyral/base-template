A lot goes into selling a home, and today we’ll be highlighting five specific tasks that all sellers must tackle to find and secure the perfect buyer. Some of these tasks are common sense, but others may surprise you:

**1. Reach all homebuyers.** One of the ways our team achieves this is by promoting our clients’ listings on social media, in addition to other traditional marketing platforms. And we don’t just stick to common sites like Zillow or Trulia—we maximize exposure by also posting on sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. In an increasingly web-based world, this step is essential.<br><br>Another way we help our clients’ listings appeal to a wide range of buyers is by encouraging sellers to invest in smart technology and energy-efficient appliances. Installing a programmable thermostat, adding attic insulation, or fixing air leaks around doors and windows can have a major impact on how buyers view your home. You don’t have to shell out tens of thousands of dollars to make your home eco-friendly. Swapping out your flooring or window screens for green alternatives is an easy way to show buyers that you are “environmentally woke.”

**2. Make your home move-in ready.** Tackling large home repairs, such as those related to structural, mechanical, or safety issues, is important, but so is fixing smaller problems. Whether it’s fixing the roof or a leaky pipe, it’s important to take every possible step in making your house the kind of place a buyer would want to call their home. Ordering a pre-listing inspection is a great way to do this, as it will point you toward the issues that the buyer would otherwise uncover themselves later on in the deal.

**3. Order professional listing photos.** Listing photos are often a buyer’s first impression of your home, which is why our team has a professional photographer on staff ready to help make your property shine when the time comes for you to sell.

**4. Prepare for open houses.** When the time comes to let buyers into your home, it should be neat, neutral, and welcoming. Our team would be happy to guide you on the specific steps you should take when preparing your home.

**5. Pet-proof your home (inside and out).** The last thing you want is for a buyer to step on something other than grass when they go to check out your backyard. We may love our four-legged family members, but it’s important to remove all traces of them before letting buyers look around. So don’t forget to take care of any pet-related odor or damage as you prepare to list.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
