Did you know that home values are at an all-time high? And that during this time, if you want, you can use the equity in your current home to purchase a new home?

Recently I have seen some of my clients accessing their equity to move up and buy the home of their dreams. If you want to do this, **you should know that you have a finite amount of time to access that equity** while values remain high.

Many of you bought your house as a first-time homeowner. This starter home has been wonderful for you, but since then your family has probably grown and you have realized that you have outgrown the property.

**There is not a better time than now to pull out what you can by refinancing and getting cash.** Or you can turn your current house into a rental and build your real estate portfolio. Another option is selling your house and accessing all of the equity and putting it toward a down payment to purchase your dream home. You have the unique opportunity to take advantage of low rates while home values at an all-time high.
