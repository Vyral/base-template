Today I was recently joined by my good friend Brandi Stokes to talk a little bit about the advantages of buying a home with her company, Cameo Homes.

**Cameo Homes has been building custom homes in the area for over 50 years and is one of the most respected custom home builders in the area.** They build for people of all ages and budgets and a big part of their client base is referral and repeat homeowners.

What sets Brandi apart is the fact that she always tries to put herself in her customer’s shoes. She doesn’t just want to know how many bedrooms or bathrooms someone needs, she wants to know how they’re going to use the home so she can get some better ideas about how to make the home more efficient for them.

**Since we are in such a highly-populated military market, the fact that her husband is active-duty military helps her relate to her clients more easily and use her experience to help educate potential homebuyers.** Education is key when it comes to building a custom home, and Brandi understands this and makes it a priority.

Not a lot of other builders have the experience that Cameo Homes has. Because of this, they have a lot of flexibility with their floorplans to customize them for each individual client’s needs. Although Cameo Homes isn’t a high-volume home building company, they are a high-quality home building company. **Whether you’re in Caline, Coe, Belton, and the surrounding areas, they’re able to help home builders make their dreams a reality.**

Their prospective homeowners come in with and without land. Deciding where you want to live is a big decision because 95% of the homes that Cameo Homes builds are forever homes.

To learn more about Cameo Homes and how they might be able to help you, visit their website [here](http://www.cameohomesdf.com/) or give me a call or send me an email today. Stay tuned for part two of this series, which will be coming out in a few weeks.
