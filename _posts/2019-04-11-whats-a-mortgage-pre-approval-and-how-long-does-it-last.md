Today I wanted to talk about how long a mortgage pre-approval lasts. The way the market has been, I know people have been frustrated with our low inventory. **However, that should increase soon and reduce the congestion in the market for buyers, making it easier to buy a home.**

Usually, a pre-approval lasts for about three months. Things can change in a lot of ways in a short period of time. From losing a job to getting a new job or buying a car, **all of that can affect your credit score and your pre-approval.**

If you’re ready to buy a home, a pre-approval is a must. Here’s how it works: **When you talk with a lender, they will ask you questions and record your financial documents to determine if you can afford a home and how much of a home you can afford.** Once you get a pre-approval letter, it will tell you that you are approved for a certain amount. You don’t have to use all of that amount, though, if you don’t want to or if you are uncomfortable with the monthly payment.

If you got a pre-approval last year and didn’t end up buying a home but are ready to now, it’s a great time to get pre-approved once more.

If you have any questions about pre-approval or need recommendations for any local lenders to help you out, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
