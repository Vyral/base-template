When you buy a new house, you’re obviously the first owner. You’ll be able to pick from different models, see the house being built, and you’ll know everything that’s been done with the house.

**New construction is a unique buying experience because there are more moving parts.** If you buy a new home in the early stages of construction, you may be able to pick out colors and add upgrades to customize the space to your liking. Once everything is done, you’ll be able to do a more thorough walkthrough with the builders. In Virginia, you’ll also get warranty protection on the structure for one year, and on select items for longer.

On the appraisal end, there are some different things your agent will take care of. **A lot of agents don’t know how to handle new construction pricing.** If you have any questions or are looking to purchase a new construction home, don’t hesitate to reach out to our team. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you reach your real estate goals.
