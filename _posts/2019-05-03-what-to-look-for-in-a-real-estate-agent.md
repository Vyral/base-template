There are a lot of real estate agents out there, but that doesn’t mean they’re all able to serve your needs effectively. In fact, there are some key differences that set the best agents apart from the rest.

**The average real estate agent with the Salt Lake Board of Realtors only sells four homes per year.** 50% of agents sold no homes in 2018. It’s very important to make sure the agent you choose isn’t one of these low producers.

To find out how good of an agent they are, you need to look at their track record. Don’t just focus on years of experience—you need to know how many homes they sell in a year. Here are a few questions you can ask in order to gain a better understanding:

**1\. “How many homes did you sell last year?”** This shows how productive and experienced they are.

**2\. “What is your list-to-sale price ratio?”** For example, if they list a $300,000 home and sell it for $300,000, they have a 100% list-to-sale price ratio. However, the average agent only has a 95% ratio, so it’s important to know your agent’s ratio. Mine, for example, is 99.3%.

**3\. “Do you work alone or with a team?”** If they’re a sole agent, they have to manage everything on their own. There’s so much to keep track of, so it’s much better to have an entire real estate team at your service. However, you may not want to work with a very large team that may not give you personalized service.
