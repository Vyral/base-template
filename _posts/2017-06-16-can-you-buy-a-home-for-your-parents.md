Many people would like to buy a home for their parents, but don't know the best way how. The answer largely depends on the circumstances of the parents.

Fannie Mae guidelines allow a child to buy a property for their parents, **and if the parents don't qualify, the child can purchase it as a primary residence.**The advantage of this is the lower interest rates and lower down payment requirements.

If the parents qualify for a mortgage, the child can still purchase the property, but it has to be structured as an investment property purchase, which will have more restrictive down payment requirements and higher interest rates.
