There are three critical things you should track in the sales process to make sure you hit your goals.

**1. People talked to.** The number of new people you talk to every day in the sales business matters. The more people you speak with, the better, because this communication will translate into higher earnings overall. I recommend that you make it your goal to talk to 12 new people about real estate every day, or 60 new people each week, in order to optimize your annual success.

**2. Appointments set.** When you have conversations with potential clients, you must uncover and identify their needs. Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to set appointments to discuss how you can help them resolve those needs. Track the number of appointments you set, and so long as you’re scheduling two or three each week, you should be on track to meet your goals.

**3. Clients signed.** The goal of setting these appointments is to sign people on as new clients. If you’re able to show potential clients how you can meet their needs and add value to the process, they will be more likely to seek a working relationship with you. As long as you sign at least one client a week, you should be able to achieve between 20 and 30 transactions per year.
