Have you ever considered a career in real estate? You might be the one we’re looking for! Today, I’m thrilled to share a great opportunity with you. The Ask Sarita Team, powered by PLACE at Keller Williams Sunset Corridor, is currently looking for a few amazing individuals to **join our team as Showing Agents.** Here’s what you need to know:

**What are we looking for?**

To give you an idea of the type of candidates we are looking for, or "unicorns," as we call them, think of real estate as a giant jigsaw puzzle. You have the property and the buyer; your goal is finding those two pieces that match perfectly. We want someone who enjoys exploring houses, knowing what buyers actually want, and creating that special connection.

**What’s expected of you as a showing agent?**

**Spend your mornings connecting with the amazing people in our database.** While some would refer to them as leads, we prefer to think of them as individuals, each with their own unique story and real estate needs. Your responsibility would be to engage with them, build a relationship with them, learn about their goals, and determine how the entire team can best serve them. **Active listening is a big part of working with buyers.** It is truly important to understand their needs and find that dream property that aligns with their vision.

**Experience is not a main concern.** Whether you are new to the industry or a seasoned pro, your passion for helping others is what matters most. Don’t worry, because we will train you. All you have to do is be open to learning and enjoy doing it.

We have grown to the point where we need passionate people to join our team so we can continue to serve everyone who needs our guidance.

So, if you are a follow-up pro, enjoy connecting with people, are up for the task of matching buyers with the perfect property for them, and are comfortable using our technology systems, you could be the missing piece that we've been looking for.

If this sounds like something that you are interested in, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call, text, or send us an email. Rest assured that your application with us will be treated with the utmost confidentiality.

If you have questions, head over to asksarita.com. We are eager to chat with you, and if you’re the one we’re looking for, we will happily welcome you aboard!
