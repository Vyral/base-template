What changes in real estate should sellers prepare for? Today, we're revisiting the real estate changes that started in mid-August, this time for the seller’s side of the transaction. Most changes have happened on the buyer's side, but there are some minor adjustments that sellers should be aware of. Overall, 95% of the process remains the same aside from some updates on the following:

**1\. Listing contract.** Minor changes were made on how commissions are disclosed and divided between buyers, brokers, and sellers. We had to adjust our process to comply with the new rules from the NAR.

**2\. Purchase agreement.** As listing agents we have to discuss with you your options about how buyer’s agents compensation is paid out. You can opt for broker-to-broker payout or indicate on the purchase agreement whether you want to add a commission.

These are two of the biggest changes in the community which resulted to a lot more paperwork. However, we simplified some of these into your listing contract and in our listing process to make it easier for you.

Our goal is for you to not feel any major changes that’s why we take the extra effort to address most of your concerns, discuss with you our process, and explain the changes for a seamless transaction. If you have any questions about the changes that took effect in mid-August 2024, **feel free to contact us anytime at (952) 212-3597.** We'd love to discuss them with you.
