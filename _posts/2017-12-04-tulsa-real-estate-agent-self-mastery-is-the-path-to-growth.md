Are your schedule and general thought-process adding value to your life?
If not, switch things up so that they do.

Today I want to talk about self-mastery. It’s one of the Six Personal Perspectives that Gary Keller, Co-Founder & Chairman of the Board for Keller Williams Realty, wrote about in his NY Times Best Seller, The Millionaire Real Estate Agent. **He discovered that the most successful real estate agents have a similar mindset when it comes to success** and boiled this mindset down to six fundamental perspectives that are at the core of Keller Williams Realty’s education for its agents.

Self Mastery is the mindset, process, and habits associated with making sound decisions for desired results & self growth. It's the self control that comes from having a clear vision & the determination to see it physically manifest.

In other words, it's "KAIZEN" a Japanese term and philosophy meaning "continuous improvement" or "change for better." You've mastered "Self" when your thoughts, words, actions, and reactions all align with your goals/mission.

**Self-mastery is to continue to work on, and ultimately master, you.**

I’ve been thinking about scenarios from my own life and business that I could share with you to help you understand what I mean. One of the things I’ve done for myself is created a habit of getting up early and having “me time” while exercising on the treadmill.

I was using that 30 minutes of walking on the treadmill in the morning to watch Netflix and TV series from Amazon Video that I normally never watched. It was just guilty-pleasure time, and I think it’s important to have that. However, I was noticing that I was filling my brain with silly stuff**—things that didn’t matter or add value to my life.**

So I switched that routine. Instead of mindless shows, I started listening to audiobooks about growth, mindset, and leadership, or else inspirational and motivational videos with John Maxwell or Tony Robbins—anything that could add value to my life.

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take time for yourself and do some of those guilty-pleasure things, because those are fun and enjoyable as well. I just had found that I wasn’t growing. And by listening to these different thoughts on leadership, business, and life balance, I was able to trigger thoughts in my own mind that **inspired me to think of new ways and ideas to better my family, business, friends, and community.**

Do these little things that tweak your mind and your schedule to where you’re adding some value to yourself so that you can continue to improve.

Let me know how you work on your self-mastery, and I can in return share some more ways to grow through this practice. Life is a journey; we’re continuing to grow every single day.
