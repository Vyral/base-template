It’s spring and that means it’s time to get our hands dirty in the garden.&nbsp;

With that being said, today I’d like to discuss some pros and cons of a common gardening option: raised beds.&nbsp;

One benefit of raised garden beds is simply that they’re nice to look at. Beyond that, raised beds also keep animals from getting to your garden.&nbsp;

**They also allow you to plant earlier, since the loose soil you fill the bed with will be warmer than the ground itself.**

Now, let’s take a look at some of the downsides.&nbsp;

First, they’re pricey. You’re going to have to invest in the bed, the materials, soil, and fertilizer to get started. **Raised beds also aren’t as sustainable as simply planting your garden in the ground.**

Ultimately, the decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances. And if you’re unsure, my friends over at **[Grogg’s Green Barn](http://www.groggsgreenbarn.com){: target="_blank"}** can help you decide what gardening solutions may work best for you.
