Years ago, I felt super frustrated and was ready to burn out of the real estate business. I was working like crazy and neglecting what was most important in my life.&nbsp;

Then, however, I tried a mission statement exercise at a class I’d been taking, and that’s when I discovered my personal passion.&nbsp;

I learned that I loved training, teaching, and sharing everything I’ve learned over the years with other real estate agents. **I feel it’s my duty to help as many agents as possible with their struggles and show them how to live a counterbalanced life** so they can help other families buy and sell homes and spend quality time with their own family.

By discovering my personal mission statement, I set myself on the path to becoming a Keller Williams University instructor. For a long time, I was held back from doing this by a fear of public speaking. I started teaching in my own market center, though, and I eventually created my own class that allowed me to practice speaking in front of others. That’s when I really got the confidence to achieve this goal.&nbsp;

Becoming an instructor takes a lot of time, energy, and focus. You have to take two classes and teach until you have at least 75 good reviews from your former students. After that, you need to be regionally approved. Finally, you need the approval of three team leaders in their respective market centers.

**It took me two years, but I’ve grown a lot by being on this journey, and it all started by discovering my passion.** If becoming an instructor sounds like something you’d be interested in doing, I’d love to share more of my story with you. Also, remember that I’m certified to teach and train all over, so if you’d like me to visit your area, I’d be happy to oblige.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions or there’s anything else I can share with you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking to you.<br>&nbsp;
