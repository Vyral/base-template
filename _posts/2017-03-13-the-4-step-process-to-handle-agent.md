How can you hit agent request leads out of the park? Use our four-step process.

How should you handle an agent request lead?

When a potential buyer reaches out to you about one of your properties, that is a fastball right down the plate. A lot of agents miss them, but you should be hitting them out of the park.

We have a four-step process to handle these calls.

**First, you have to get them into the house.** Assume that they are pre-qualified and say, “What questions do you have about the home and when would you like to preview it?” You need to ask when they want to see the home right away. Otherwise, if you just ask what questions they have about the home, they will hang up once you give them the answer. You need to ask those two questions right off the bat.

Once you set the appointment, why should you show them just one house? Ask, “Are there any other homes you’ve been looking at?” Most of the time, the answer is yes, so go ahead and set the appointment.

A lot of people don’t want to set an appointment without a pre-qualification. At this point in the call, though, you have no rapport with this person, so go ahead and set the appointment. You can always cancel if they aren’t pre-qualified. If you have a lender you can put them in touch with that day, then you can help them get pre-qualified.

The next question you need to ask is, **“Are you working with an agent?”** You don’t want to step on any toes, so ask if they have signed anything with another agent.

Finally, ask them if they are pre-qualified. At this point, you have built some rapport and you have an appointment. Have them send you their pre-approval and then you are ready to go look at some houses.

This is part of our team’s training and it works very well. If you have any other questions about agent request leads or if there is anything else you have questions about, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!
