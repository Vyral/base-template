Now that fall is here, we have some really great events coming up that we're excited to see you at. We've also got a new addition to the team that we'd like you to meet.

We have some really fun and exciting things happening right now, and some great events planned for the fall.

First, I'm happy to introduce Michelle Soquet, our new executive assistant and customer care specialist. She's awesome and thrilled to be here.

Additionally, **we have lots of great inventory right now that we think you should check out** from investment properties at $50,000 to a high-end contemporary home at $650,000.

As for events, we're starting with "Have a Good Night" at Gilroy's on October 12th from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. We're hosting this event with food and live musicâ€“hopefully we'll get nice some weather to enjoy the patio!

**On October 20th, we'll have a really fun Trunk or Treat event** here at the office to get ready for Halloween. Get the kids dressed up and come get some candy with us!

We're also bringing back the popular event "Gather the Girls" on November 3rd with
Meghan Blum Interiors. You can start your Christmas shopping here; we'll have local vendors and local artists.

Finally, we want you to save the date for our third annual **Reindeer Day.** Last year, we had 800 people show up, so we'll have VIP tickets for our clients and contacts so you won't have to wait in line.

We're really excited for these events! If you have any questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you soon!
