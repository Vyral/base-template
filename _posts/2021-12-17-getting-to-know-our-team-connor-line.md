Today we want to introduce you to Connor Line, the Home Advisor at the Dave Hooke team. We’ll talk about how he got into real estate, what he does for us, and what makes this team different.&nbsp;

**Dave: Connor, why did you get into real estate, and what made you decide to join this team?**

Connor: I joined the Dave Hooke team back in October of 2019, and one of my biggest motivations for doing so is that I wanted to work with the best. So far, it looks like I chose correctly\! Before I got into real estate, I was a practicing attorney, but I wanted something more out of my career. I wanted something dynamic and challenging without the soul-crushing grind of law, and I’ve found exactly what I’m looking for with this team.&nbsp;

Dave: One of the things we appreciate the most about you is your sense of humor; you never fail to make us laugh with your positive attitude. On a different note, a lot of people don’t know that everyone on a real estate team isn’t a Realtor. **What do you do for us?&nbsp;**

Connor: At this point, I work solely with buyers. I like to focus on one thing, and helping people get into their first home has been incredibly rewarding.

**Dave: What’s your favorite part about your job and the team?**

Connor: For my job, I love how dynamic every day is. On Monday I could be in a high-end residential area, and by Thursday I could be knee-deep in corn looking at a country property. As for the team, the people I work with are easily the best part.&nbsp;

**Dave: What’s your biggest challenge in the industry?&nbsp;**

Connor: I just care too much. I try too hard to help my clients, and it’s a burden I carry every day. Just kidding—while I do love helping our clients, my biggest challenge is probably the keys. Not only do I lose them, but even when I have them on me, I have trouble using them.&nbsp;

One time, I locked myself in the basement of a property with a client. I called everybody, but no one could help. Eventually, we had to call the local police, and my relationship with keys hasn’t been the same ever since.&nbsp;

**Dave: As you think about the next three or four years of your career, what are your goals?**

Connor: I’d love to help more clients get into homes, but I’d also like to get into commercial properties. I want to push myself as far as I can go.

We’d like to thank Connor for telling us about himself and his experience on the team. If you’d like to learn more about our team, give us a call at (717) 216-0860 or send us an email at [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com). We look forward to hearing from you\!
