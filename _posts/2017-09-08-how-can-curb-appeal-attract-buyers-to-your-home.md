First impressions are incredibly important, especially when selling your home. Before the buyer gets out of the car, they’re already 80% sure about whether or not they are seriously interested in your home.&nbsp;

In order to attract more buyers to your home, there are a few things you can do to enhance your curb appeal:&nbsp;

**1. Maintain your lawn.** Make sure the grass is neatly manicured.&nbsp;

**2. Don’t overlook pressure washing the exterior of your home.** Pressure washing only costs a few hundred dollars and it makes all the difference in the world. Whenever a buyer comes to a home that hasn’t been pressure washed on the outside, they automatically judge what the inside will look like. Don’t let those buyers get a bad impression of your home.&nbsp;

**3. Don’t overlook the driveway.** When you do the pressure washing, you can also have them do the entire driveway for a few extra dollars.&nbsp;

**4. Invest in outdoor lighting.** Serious buyers will drive by your home after dark to check things out, so install some landscape lighting in the flowerbeds to make your home more presentable.&nbsp;

**5. Add more color to your flowerbeds.** Vibrant flowerbeds will catch a buyer’s eye. Shrubs, annuals, and perennials will help your home show in its best light.&nbsp;

**6. Make sure everything is clean.** Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes. Would you enjoy hanging out in the backyard? Clean up the interior of your home too so that you are always ready for showings.&nbsp;

If you follow these tips, you will attract more buyers to your home. At the end of the day, these tips help you net the most money for your home sale.&nbsp;
