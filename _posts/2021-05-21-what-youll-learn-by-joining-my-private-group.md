I’d like to take a moment to cordially invite all of you to my private Facebook Group called “Arizona Buy & Hold Real Estate Investments (R.E.I.) Group.” I’ll provide information for investors who are looking to add real estate to their portfolio. I’ll also be interviewing various professionals about financing, taxes, and more.&nbsp;

**Overall, this group is going to help you make more money buying and holding real estate. You can join <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/630082377568084">here.</a></u>**

Tina Tamboer from The Cromford Report is just one example of the market experts I’ll be talking to in this group. I want to make this group your primary resource for information on investing and building wealth through real estate.

If you have any questions for me about the group or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
