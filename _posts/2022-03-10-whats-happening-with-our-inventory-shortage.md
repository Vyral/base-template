If you’ve done any reading about our market, you know that our inventory is historically low. Supply isn’t just scarce in the Twin Cities either; this issue affects the whole country. That’s why today we want to talk about how our inventory shortage affects both buyers and sellers in our current market.&nbsp;

To illustrate just how low our inventory is, let’s look at an example. A standard price range for single-family homes in Savage and Prior Lake is between $400,000 and $500,000. In this range, there are currently only nine houses on the market. Of those nine, eight are active, and four of them are already under contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Every price range is affected by the inventory shortage.** If you’re looking for a more affordable home, the issue might even be worse. Since prices have appreciated so much recently, $400,000 is a new benchmark for first-time buyers. If you’re looking to buy, you need to make sure you work with a great agent so that you don’t miss out.&nbsp;

So what about sight-unseen offers? Are people really buying homes without ever stepping foot in the door? The answer is yes. **When things are this competitive, buyers will do just about anything to win a house.** Just the other week, a buyer we were working with scheduled a showing at a $1 million home. The house was in coming-soon status, so no one had actually had a showing there yet. Unfortunately, it didn’t matter. Our showing was canceled because someone made a sight-unseen offer, and the seller accepted.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller, this could be an incredible time to enter the market. Buyers are starved for inventory. If the unique features of your home fit the market, you are likely to receive a favorable sight-unseen offer.&nbsp;

This market is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. If you want a great team to help you navigate it, please reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you\!
