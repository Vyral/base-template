Have you thought about using vacation rental services like Airbnb as a property investment? It can offer a great return on your investment, but you need to consider a few important factors first.

Many real estate investors have taken on a new strategy of using vacation rentals like Airbnb and VRBO to generate returns. If this is a type of investment you're thinking about adding to your portfolio, there are three main points you need to be aware of first:

**1. Location and zoning:** For example, Scottsdale is by far the best area for vacation rentals because the demand is high for these properties. You have to be aware of zoning as well since certain subdivisions don't allow short-term rentals. You need to check with your CCNR or HOA to make sure they allow this kind of rental.

**2. Management companies:** This isn't a 'set it and forget it' kind of investment; it's very active. More tenants coming and going means a better return, but it also means more time. A management company can handle the influx of income, the books, cleaning, and other similar things.

**3. Exit strategy:** As with any investment, ask yourself why you're doing it. Have an exit strategy that allows you to rent the property long-term if you decide to change your investment strategy. Also make sure you buy a property that has a good chance at appreciating in value.

There are plenty of other nuances you'll need to consider for this type of investment. It's a full-time job to have a vacation rental. The upside is quite high though.

I recently spoke with a client who bought a property about seven years ago who is now only about a year away from paying off his 30-year mortgage on the property. His strategy was to put every dollar of profit from the vacation rental right back toward the principal and, as a result, he's going to pay off a 30-year mortgage in eight years or so.

**You also have to provide full furnishing for the vacation rental from plates, silverware, and dishes to microwaves and furniture.** Then there are towels, linens, and toiletries. The list goes on and on. Basically, you can't just consider the cost of acquisition for the house, you must factor in all those furnishings as well. Costs really add up when you start talking about chairs, beds, and couches.

We've helped a lot of clients maximize their investment with this strategy with a great return on their investment. If you have any other questions about this investment strategy, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to talk with you about it!
