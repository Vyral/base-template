If you are looking to buy, sell, or invest in Boise or the surrounding areas, there is a strong chance you will encounter a multiple offer situation. 

So, today I would like to share a few important tips on how to navigate this currently common scenario. Let’s start with what buyers should keep in mind: 

**1. Treat your offer like a resume.** Your offer will represent your potential as a buyer, so it is important to present it (and therefore yourself) in the best possible light. Make sure your offer is accompanied by a pre-approval letter and an earnest money deposit, as well. Doing this will indicate your commitment to the seller. And, like a resume, your offer should be clean, clear, and precise. The agent you work with to craft this offer will also have a major impact on the success of your deal.

It is crucial for you to work with a Realtor who is a strong negotiator and can help you develop an offer that appeals to a seller’s specific needs. Finally, some buyers may consider including a personal “love letter” as a supplement to their offer. This letter should describe what winning this property would mean for you and your family, and could be the key to swaying a seller’s decision in your favor.

**2. Create an offer with more than just a strong price.** Truthfully, a seller’s decision is not always just about money. Terms can often be equally important. Different sellers will have different personal needs, so keeping these in mind when making an offer could make or break your success as a buyer. Have your agent contact the listing agent and discuss items that are significant to the seller. This will help to position you well above competing offers. 

Moving on, let’s briefly touch on some advice for sellers facing multiple offers. First and foremost, you must determine what matters most to you. Think critically about what it is you hope to gain from a deal, and filter their choice of offer through that set of priorities.

Whether money, time, or something else entirely is the driving factor behind your decision between offers, **the key is to know what you want and to seek that out. **
