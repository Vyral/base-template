Today, I have a quick St. Cloud market update to share with you. 

As our spring market progresses, the market has been very strong. We’ve had a very nice influx of new listings, and they are selling pretty quickly. **Most homes are selling in one, two, or three weeks and, in a few cases, with multiple offers.** 

This can be frustrating for buyers, but sellers love it. The nice thing is there are a lot of options to choose from.

We have a few people looking at new construction, and we have lots available in and around the area. **New construction typically starts at about $200,000.** If you have some interest in building, are looking for a lot, or would like to get connected with a very good builder that has some excellent building sites, we can assist you with that this year as well. 

Inventory is a little low, so if you’ve been thinking about selling your home, now is a great time to put your property on the market. 

I would love to help you find a home or help you with the sale of your current home. If you have any other questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to talking to you soon.<br>
