By now, you’ve probably heard about **the Federal Reserve’s recent cut to interest rates.** Today my friend Bree joins me again to discuss the immediate impact this development will have on buyers (and by extension, sellers).&nbsp;

This past July, the Fed went forward with a 0.25% rate cut—**the first time this has happened in over a decade.** As a consequence, mortgage rates are already falling and until recently, they had remained relatively flat. The Fed’s intervention is actually great news for buyers because it means an increase in affordability. &nbsp;

Let’s use an example to further illustrate this point. Say you were buying a $200,000 home this year. Back in January, the fixed rate on a 30-year loan was at around 4.875%. **With the recent cut, the 30-year fixed rate is down by a full percentage point: 3.875%.&nbsp;**

As recently as this year, your P&I (principal and interest) payment on a $200,000 mortgage would have been $1,058 per month. If you bought a home today at a 3.875% rate, that same payment could get you into a $225,000 home. That’s greater purchasing power for you as a buyer\! Given the level of competition in our current market, that 1% rate decrease between January and today could give you the best of both worlds: **the ability to buy the house you want and stay within your budget when you do.&nbsp;**
