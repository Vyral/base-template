Today we’re giving you a closer look at how our move-out inspection process works. We start by sending detailed and clear instructions to our tenants to prepare them for the process. Then we schedule a date and time to perform the move-out inspection. **At that time, the tenant turns in the keys, and we have 14 days to complete our process and return their security deposit.**

I go into the property, take lots of pictures, take notes, and document everything. Then I compare my notes to the property condition disclosure form that was filled out when they moved in.&nbsp;

There are more items to worry about when tenants move out than when tenants move in. If there are new damages, that's considered negligence. It’s the tenants’ responsibility to pay for the damages out of their security deposit.

**After I take my pictures (roughly 150 for a one-bedroom unit), any items that need to be addressed are addressed and repaired before the 14-day timeframe expires.**

If you have any questions about this procedure or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
