Today I just want to answer a couple common questions that I’m frequently asked about foreclosures and short sales in the current market.

Every buyer out there wants a deal. Usually what they mean when they say that is that they want a foreclosure or a short sale. The reality of the situation, however, is that in today’s market, those types of listings just don’t exist.<br><br>**Out of, say, 200 homes that I’ve sold in the past two years, maybe between one and three of those were foreclosures,** and I don’t think any of them was a short sale. They have literally disappeared from the market here on the Treasure Coast.

**That’s actually a great thing—it means the market has strengthened.** We’ve come full circle. Florida is one of the hardest-hit markets in the country, but the fact that those listings aren’t even coming up on the market anymore is a **huge indicator of a healthy market and that you can buy with security.**

When looking for a home, expect to buy a resale because that’s the inventory that you’re gonna find out there. It doesn’t mean that you can’t get a good buy or a great deal, it just means you shouldn’t wait for something that isn’t going to come up—those short sales and foreclosures just aren’t out there any longer.
