Here are the four most common misconceptions going around about our current hyper-seller’s market:

**1\. We have a lack of inventory because of the abundance of buyers.** Part of why we’re lacking in inventory is because sellers are nervous about putting their homes on the market before they find a replacement property. The beauty of this market is that you can dictate those terms as a seller. We have been able to negotiate 30-day and 60-day rent-back agreements, often for free. This gives sellers extra time to find a replacement property.

**2\. A home’s condition is unimportant.** Your home will sell quickly if you do absolutely nothing to it, but you won’t get top dollar. We like to go room to room with our clients to discover what can be done to the home to help it sell for the most money possible.

**3\. Accurate pricing doesn’t matter.** Sellers want to get top dollar, but the broker has to have the right strategy on how to get there. Homes are regularly selling for over asking price right now. If a house is priced high from the start and buyers think they have to go above and beyond that price to buy it, they won’t even consider the home. We’re starting to see houses like that sit stagnant on the market.

**4\. MLS-only listings are FSBO.** When you’re getting involved in a for sale by owner (FSBO) situation, there are a ton of steps that can be missed. Disclosures are important, and so is pricing. There is so much that goes into the job, and you should have trust with your broker that they're guiding you to get top dollar.

The one thing we really want to emphasize is that yes, you can sell a home pretty easily in this market, but selling for top dollar while being protected from any mishaps is something you’ll only get with a team like ours.
