Spring is in full swing, and do you know what that means? It’s time to go to the farmer’s market.

It’s that time of year again. Spring is in full swing, summer is on the way, and most of us will be visiting a farmer’s market here in the upcoming weekends.

I don’t know about you, but I couldn’t be more excited. I always love going out in the community, visiting with local farmers and small business owners, and getting some delicious produce in the process. If there are any urban farmers out there that need some space to grow their veggies, I’ve got plenty of space out here in Sandy!

**What are your favorite things about the farmer’s market?** Let me know in the comment section below. I love picking out fresh tomatoes, and anything with garlic in it instantly has my attention.

There are a ton of different markets around here. There’s the Wheeler Farm market, the giant downtown market, and the Park City Park Silly Market in the summer. **The Park Silly Market is one of my favorites** because we just head up their with our dogs and enjoy all the art, food, and drinks they have to offer.

So get out there and let me know what some of your best farmer’s market finds were. If you have any real estate questions or needs in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
