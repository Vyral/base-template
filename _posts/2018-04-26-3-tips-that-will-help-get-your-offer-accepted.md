If you’re a buyer in our seller’s market, here are three important tips that will help you be aggressive with your offer and get it accepted:

**1. Don’t get too picky.** Be flexible with your criteria and what you’re looking for. Prices are rising daily, so you want to get on the elevator before it gets any higher, so to speak.

**2. Submit your highest and best offe****r.** When you’re ready to make an offer on a home, be aware that you likely won’t be the only buyer making an offer for it. Many listings are getting multiple offers right now, so there will be no room for negotiation.

**3. Ask yourself if you’re willing to pay above appraised value.** A lot of sellers are looking for buyers who are willing to do this. Basically, this means if your offer for a home is $330,000 but that home’s appraisal ends up being $320,000, the seller will expect you to pay the difference in cash for the agreed-upon price.

Of course, you also want to work with a good agent who will aggressively look for the perfect home for you.

As always, if you have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
