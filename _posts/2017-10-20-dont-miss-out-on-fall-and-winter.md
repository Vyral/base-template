</i>*</i><i>*Today, Id like to give you an overview of the top reasons to buy or sell in the fall or winter months. 

First, Id like to start with some of the advantages of selling at this time of year: 

## 1. Less competition on the market. During this time of year, the inventory is down. This contributes to less competition, putting you in a better position by default. 
## 2. The house is show-ready. Because kids are in school during these later months, houses tend to be a little cleaner. In turn, this means that houses require a lot less preparation before a home showing. 
## 3. Vacations are over. With people having returned from their trips and outings during the warmer months, more buyers are back in town. 
## 4. Buyers are more serious. Buyers who are on the market at this time of year arent just looking for fun. These buyers are genuinely committed to finding and purchasing a home. 
## 5. The appeal of fall decor. Who doesnt love fall decor? The change of colors adds some natural beauty to any property, and fall decorations on the interior of a home can make buyers feel cozy and warm. 
## 6. Its cooler outside. Why would anyone want to move when its hot out? The colder weather is perfect for the moving process.

Now, Id like to move on to the advantages of buying during fall and winter: 

## 1. Good deals are available. Some of the best deals of the year are done in the fall and winter months, especially for properties that have been sitting on the market for quite some time. 
## 2. Its a lot easier to look at houses during school season. When the kids are in school, its easier for people to go out and browse the market freely. 
## 3. Fewer multiple offer situations. Since many of the homes on the market have been sitting for awhile, there is less competition for certain types of properties. 
## 4. Year-end sales for furniture. The later months of the year are a great time to take advantage of sales, which will aid you in furnishing your new home. 
## 5. Its easier to contract necessary services. Since there tends to be less activity on the market at this time of year, booking contractors wont be as difficult.
