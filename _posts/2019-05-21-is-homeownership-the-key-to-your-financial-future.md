First-time homebuyers often focus on two things: the price of a home and the monthly payment they’ll be bound to after purchasing it. This is quite understandable. However, there’s one more thing you need to consider when buying a house: the future value of the property.

In a nutshell, appreciation, or the increase in prices over time, is how a majority of wealth is built in real estate. **That’s why homeownership is a great, stable, long-term investment.**

There are ultimately two ways to take advantage of your home’s equity: actively and passively.

**By paying off a mortgage during your working years, you actively eliminate a big expense from your plate during your retirement years.&nbsp;**

What’s more is that if you’re not great about having a savings plan, **owning a home is a great opportunity to passively create a financial cushion that renting can’t.** If you start when you’re young, it gives you a longer opportunity to create wealth.

Now, owning a home doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you can have a greater net worth, but homeownership has traditionally been one of the most stable opportunities to build wealth. Obviously, real estate values do fluctuate over time, but it’s still a great vehicle for stable growth for many people. It gives you an opportunity (and a structure) to build wealth. &nbsp;After all, a home isn’t just four walls that provide you shelter—it’s a place for you to grow.
