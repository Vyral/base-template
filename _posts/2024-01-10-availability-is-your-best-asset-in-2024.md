If you want to grow your real estate business in 2024, here’s my best piece of advice: **Your availability is your greatest ability.**

The truth is that we live in an Amazon world—in other words, people want what they want, when they want it. If you aren’t available to answer questions your clients might have, they’ll probably just move on to someone else. I’ve seen too many great agents lose business because they just don’t have the time to be available to everyone all the time.

One of the great things about our team is that we take care of all the busywork for you, so you can spend more time doing what really matters, like being available to your clients. If you have questions about what we can do for you or anything else, please call or email me or my team. We’d love to hear from you!
