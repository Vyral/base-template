I’m joined today by Randal Rupert, a principal broker with Keller Williams who will be telling us about how to secure an exclusive buyer broker agreement. By getting more comfortable with this document, agents can have it done more quickly in a client relationship.

**Many agents are tentative about bringing up the agreement too early on.** However, the document helps to protect the buyer as well as the agent. A good way to present it is to relate it to a business situation—by presenting the document as a way to get the best return on their investment, the buyer will feel more comfortable.

**There are four key things that agents should bring to the table:**

1\. Specific market knowledge about the real estate industry<br>2\. Good relationships with their clients and vendors<br>3\. Negotiation skills<br>4\. Time for their clients

Essentially, the buyer broker agreement provides clients value and gives agents the chance to earn a commission based on their work. The agent will only be paid if the buyer purchases or sells a property—they aren’t forced to do anything.&nbsp;

After presenting this, agents should ask, “Is there any reason we wouldn’t want to work together?” **It’s a good chance for clients to explain their side, and it lets agents probe further if they have any complaints.**

I’d like to thank Randal for giving us some great insight. You can contact him by calling **801-910-0917** or emailing [Randal@KWParkCity.com](mailto:Randal@KWParkCity.com).&nbsp;
