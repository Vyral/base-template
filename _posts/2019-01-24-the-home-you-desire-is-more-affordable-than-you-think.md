<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether you’re thinking of buying your first home, your dream home, or your second home, it doesn’t cost as much as you think.</em></p>

If you’re thinking of buying a second home, I have good news for you. &nbsp;

Florida is the No. 1 location in the country to buy a second home. And honestly, why wouldn’t it be? We have great weather, plenty of beaches, and outdoor dining even in the middle of winter. You might have already known all of that, but did you also know you only need to put 10% down to buy a second home? That’s right—it only takes a little bit of money to enjoy paradise.&nbsp;

**The good news doesn’t stop at second-home buyers, though.** In Palm Beach County, we have roughly 1.4 million residents, and 460,000 of those people are renters. Landlords love this ratio, but why not start building your own wealth? One-third of those renters can afford to buy a home right now, they just don’t know it yet

If you’re a first-time homebuyer looking to purchase a home for $350,000 or less, you can do so with no money down. If you’re looking to buy a $500,000 home, you’ll only need $15,000 to cover the down payment. If you’re a luxury buyer, you can buy a million-dollar home for just $100,000.&nbsp;

When you think about it, **there’s no reason you shouldn’t be buying your first home, your dream home, or your second home.&nbsp;**

In our area, you have plenty of real estate agents to choose from—over 21,000, in fact. Does it really matter which one you pick? Yes it does, because only 1,200 of those agents sell 10 or more homes a year. Those agents are the ones making a full-time living in real estate, and here at Treu Group Real Estate, we’re all full-time as well. We’re committed, experienced, and we have the ability to find and close on any home you desire.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know how we can find your next home, whether it’s your first home, dream home, or second home, give us a call.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about our Palm Beach County market, feel free to reach out to us as well. We’d love to hear from you.
