*“We bought and sold a home with Wendy Sells Florida. We met them three years prior to buying and selling our properties. We had looked a property and the deal never went through. But, we were so very impressed with them that we wanted to keep trying to work with them. That’s how it happened. We never even considered using anyone else because we were so impressed with their knowledge and integrity. They actually tried to put the deal together for us to buy our home while the other home was still on the market. They helped set us up with a financier that could help us get a loan to cover the cost of the new home so that we could go ahead and purchase our new home before the other one was sold. They truly went beyond what you would normally expect from your realtor.”*<br><br>**- Kathi Dorn, Home Buyer/Seller**
