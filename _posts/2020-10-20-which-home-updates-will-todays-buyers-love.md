2020 has been anything but a great year. We’re into month seven of the COVID era, and there’s no quick end in sight. With more people working from home and students taking online classes, homebuyer trends are shifting. Here are the top four improvements buyers want to see right now that you should keep in mind if you’re listing soon:

**1\. Upgraded outdoor space.** COVID has shown us that cabin fever is a real thing. This doesn’t mean you have to build an in-ground pool tomorrow, but minor cosmetic and landscaping updates can have a huge impact. Depending on your neighborhood and budget, you may try building a firepit or an outdoor sitting area that’s weather-protected. Anything you can do to extend the life of your outdoor space is a big plus in today’s environment.&nbsp;

**2\. Functional home office and learning stations.** With so much of the workforce not returning to the office until 2021 or beyond and more students than ever learning from home, showing that your property can fit home offices and/or work stations into its layout is critical. Even if you don’t need two home offices in your house, reminding buyers that your floorspace offers that potential is key.&nbsp;

**3\. Separation of space.** For so long, open floor plans were the layout all buyers wanted, but that’s fast-changing. Now, a well-segmented floor plan is what buyers are looking for. If your floor plan doesn’t offer this, consider adding pocket doors, room dividers, or barn doors. These will minimize the volume of people using individual spaces and showcase what your home’s capable of.&nbsp;

**4\. A home gym.** More and more people are forgoing gyms and working out at home where it’s safer and more comfortable. This means buyers need space for stationary bikes and other types of fitness equipment. Even if you don’t have the space to accommodate these things, try to at least convert a corner of a room into an area where buyers can envision their future workouts happening. This way they’ll know their health will stay a top priority if they buy your home.&nbsp;
