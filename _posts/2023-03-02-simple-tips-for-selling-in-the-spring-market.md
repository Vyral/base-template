Did you know that spring is usually the busiest time of year for the real estate market? If you want to sell your home during this season and get the best deal possible, we have you covered. Today we’re sharing a few easy ways to sell your house quickly and for more money.&nbsp;

The most important thing you can do is stage your home. You may think that all staging is when a professional comes in and brings new furniture into your house to make it look like a model home, but that’s actually pretty rare. Most staging is when a professional comes in and gives you practical advice to make your existing home as appealing to buyers as possible. Statistically speaking, about 70% of homes that are staged sell for 9% more than homes that aren’t.

**The easiest way to start staging is to declutter.** Gather things you don’t use very often and start cleaning every corner of your house. You were probably going to clean your home before you moved anyways, so you might as well do it now.&nbsp;

After you clean your house, consider some cosmetic questions: How does the paint look? Is it looking a little dingy? Are the walls scuffed? Do you need to get the carpets cleaned? How long has it been since you've done that? As the weather starts to warm outside, freshen up the flower beds, plant flowers, mow the lawn, and get your curb appeal looking as good as possible.&nbsp;

Staging is all about the little details, so if you’d like some professional help, don’t hesitate to call or email us with any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!
