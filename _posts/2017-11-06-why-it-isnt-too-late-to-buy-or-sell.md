You may be seeing fewer “For Sale” signs now that the summer is over. This can actually be a great thing for buyers and sellers alike. Today, I’d like to share four surprising benefits of buying or selling in the fall.

**1.) Tax breaks.** If you’re a buyer who closes escrow before December 31st, you might get a nice write-off on your taxes. For sellers, closing costs and home improvements may also carry tax benefits.

**2.) Home for the holidays.** Buying or selling early in the fall will allow you to be nicely situated in your home before the holidays arrive. You’ll also avoid some winter weather. Additionally, buying or selling during this less busy time of year means you’ll have increased access to movers and other necessary resources.

**3.) Less competition.** There may be fewer homes on the market, but there are also fewer buyers. This means that buyers who are looking for their next home during this time of year will have a competitive edge. It also is beneficial to sellers, since the buyers who are looking are much more serious about finding a home.

**4.) Good deals.** If you’re able to get the timing right, the items you need to fix up your home could be priced to your advantage. Check out consumer reports to learn the best time of year to buy everything on your list. Also, keep holiday and Black Friday sales in mind.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
