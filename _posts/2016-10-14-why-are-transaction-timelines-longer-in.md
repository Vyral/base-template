This is because there just arent enough appraisers for all the people moving into Portland.  *<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">***Selling your Portland home?** [Check out our free home value report](http://www.searchallproperties.com/propertyvaluation-plus-one/steveschwab/Portland)*<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">***Buying a Portland home?** [Search all homes for sale](http://www.portlandlifestyleteam.com/)*<div style="text-align: center;"> 

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Our office recently had a transaction that was supposed to close at the end of September but got postponed by<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> half of a month purely because the appraisal took so long to come in. Why? 

Today weve invited Peter Wease, our preferred lender from Fairway Independent Mortgage, to talk about turn times for appraisals in the Portland area and how theyre affecting transaction timelines. According to Peter, this type of delay isnt uncommon. His company has been tracking this type of occurrence for the past year, and they see weekly updates based on different counties. 
<b> 
As you can see in the video above,</b> on September 18th, Clackamas Countys average business day turn time was almost 21 days. On October 3rd, it increased to 23 days. This is in contrast, however, to Washington County, whose average business day turn time dropped from 28 days on September 18th to 16.5 days on October 23rd. 

<div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left"> 
<div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The appraisers need help.    <span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right"> <span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The primary factor in this kind of drastic variance from county to county is the fact that **roughly 1<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">11 people are moving to Portland every single day, and there just arent enough appraisers to keep up.** The best way to change this turn time, then, is to get more help to the appraisers. 

Another consequence of this situation is that appraisal fees have soared. Appraisers are getting inundated by other appraisal management companies, so theyre demanding higher fees and being more selective in which appraisals they choose to undertake. Who pays for that increase? The customer. Its unfortunate, but its the truth. 

The moral of the story is that, for the time being, its going to be hard to close a transaction in just 30 days in the Portland area. Youd be well-advised to prepare for it to take as long as 45 or even 50 days. In addition, let your clients know about whats going on with these turn times so they can prepare as well.
