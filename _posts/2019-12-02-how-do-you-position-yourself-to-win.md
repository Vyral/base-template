<center><em>We&rsquo;re sharing the major ways you can win in the real estate market right now!</em></center>

<br>As we head toward the end of the year, how do you position yourself so you can win? I enjoy getting excellent deals. I’m sure you do too. **So how can someone win in today’s market?**

First of all, don’t be scared. The holidays are coming up and it’s a stressful time for everyone with all the running around. However, there’s so much opportunity out there, especially when you’re looking at buying a new construction home. Those builders are giving incentives away like crazy because they want to close by the end of the year.

The other way to win is to take advantage of the fact that many people are dismissing our wildly low interest rates. You want to take advantage of those if you’re considering buying a home. **Don’t let the holidays stop you\!** The federal government is not going to let the holidays stop them from increasing rates, and once they increase, you’ll miss out on how low they are. The rates are not going to stay like this forever.

Take the opportunities and what’s available to you now, especially during the holiday season. This is a wonderful time of year to be prepared and be bold\!
