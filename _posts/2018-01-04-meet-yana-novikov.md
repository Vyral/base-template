**How did I hear about Team Lally?**

I first heard from my cousin, Veronica Edwards, who is a buyer’s agent here on the team. Then, I did my own research and found out that it’s the No. 1 real estate team in Hawaii.

**What motivated me to join the team?**<br><br>As I mentioned, Team Lally is the No. 1 team in Hawaii whose team leaders are using advanced home search tools to stay ahead of the competition. They also use a home-selling device and professional expertise to provide services to our clients.

**What is my role on the team?**<br><br>I’m a buyer’s agent who works exclusively with buyers, representing them and their best interests, as well as educating them on the current market conditions.

**What do I enjoy most about working on the team?**

I love the culture here. I love the constant growth and learning from the top producers to improve my negotiation skills, as well as having fun and connecting with the community.

If you have any questions for me personally or are looking to buy a home, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
