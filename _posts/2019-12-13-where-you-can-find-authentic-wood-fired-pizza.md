On the latest episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” I want to introduce you to one of my favorite restaurants: the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria. Joining me for a quick sit-down is Amy McMillin, who co-owns the restaurant with her brother.&nbsp;

Amy and her brother have been involved in the food industry since they were teenagers, and they share a special love of Italian food. Amy got her first taste of wood-fired pizza 15 years ago when she got the chance to visit Naples, and after she did, she decided that she had to recreate the same taste back home.&nbsp;

The secret to their pizza’s amazing taste, according to Amy, **is their dedication to cooking everything fresh and authentic, just like they do in Italy.&nbsp;**

“Every morning,” she says, “we come in and light the fire in our wood-fired oven, which has no gas—we’re stacking the wood and making the fire—and we’re roasting all the fresh vegetables every day. All the meats are getting roasted. We make our dough from scratch. We import our flour from Italy. And we’re doing that fresh every single day.”

In addition to the great food, they have a fun, cool vibe inside their restaurant. Their five-year anniversary at their current location in downtown Tulsa is coming up on December 19, and in those five years, they’ve built a wine room and a second kitchen which makes handmade pasta daily. They also have an amazing patio (which I’m a big fan of), where guests are known to wine and dine year-round—even when the temperature is nearly freezing.&nbsp;

I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here, and I can’t wait to try my next Bohemian pizza.&nbsp;
