Today, Bob Taylor from Ticor Title is here to share some helpful information about vesting and how to hold title to your property.&nbsp;

**The manner in which you take title is very important** because future events in ownership could be affected by how you take title today.&nbsp;

As a husband and wife, you have a few different vesting options. You could be joint tenants, which means that when one spouse passes, the title automatically goes to the surviving tenant. You could also vest in community property. Although community property does have a tax advantage, it doesn’t automatically transfer the title to the surviving spouse. &nbsp;

Finally, you could vest in community property with right of survivorship, which combines the other two options. The title will pass automatically and you do get a tax benefit, but it all depends on your tax situation.&nbsp;

As an individual, you can take title in your name, which means there would be no joint tenancy. When someone passes away, then you are looking at a probate situation, which is the last thing you want. If you are an individual owner, you need to have a will in place or you will go into probate court. If you don’t have any heirs, then the state of California gets your property.&nbsp;

**In my opinion, the best way to hold title is through a trust.**According to Bob, a trust is a good way to stay out of the courts.

Based on personal experience, I would agree. My husband’s best friend passed away about two years ago. I had coffee with his mother this morning, and they were just wrapping up probate court.&nbsp;

It costs about $3,000 on average to set up a trust, which is probably the best way to move forward with your title.&nbsp;

We are not here to give you legal or title advice, though, so you can do more research **[here](http://ticoroc.com/services/)**.
