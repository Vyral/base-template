Most people think the best time to get in the market is June or July, but this simply isn’t the case in our Alaska market.

**Listing between the end of February and the middle of March has historically proven to be the ideal time frame for local sellers**, and our team wants to help offer even greater leverage toward your success. We will be happy to visit your property and offer our thoughts on the steps you should take to get it ready to list.&nbsp;

We’ll then give you time to get these things done before putting your home up on the MLS, and then, when you’re ready, help you beat the spring selling competition so that you can earn top dollar for your home.&nbsp;

**Cleaning, decluttering, and neutralizing your home will go a long way.** Also, don’t worry too much about your yard. It’s still winter, and buyers in our area will understand if the season has left your landscaping looking a little drab.

As a final note, our market has very little available inventory right now. With just 2.8 months’ worth of supply, there aren't many homes for buyers to choose from. This means two things: First, the market needs your home, and, second, your listing will have an even stronger chance at success right now than it would in the next few months when more listings hit the MLS.&nbsp;

Come June or July, the market will slow. **Only in Alaska could salmon season slow down real estate.** As funny as that might sound, it’s true. The bottom line is that you need to start preparing now. It’s the perfect time to list, and we’re looking forward to the opportunity to support your real estate goals.
