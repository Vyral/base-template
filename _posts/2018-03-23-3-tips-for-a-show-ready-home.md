Spring is almost here. All winter, you’ve been talking about getting the house ready to put it on the market, but now you’re asking yourself what you need to do in order actually be ready. Today, let’s take some time to talk about what you can do to ensure that you’re prepared.

**1. Declutter.** Everyday life in the home is different from life while showing a home. Get everything off the counters, and remove the random items that tend to accumulate. Let folks see the beauty of the house.

**2. Fresh paint.** As it gets to be time to put your home on the market, try painting your home with neutral colors. We want buyers to see their life in the home, not yours.

**3. Minor repairs.** There are often things around the house that have been neglected that might not necessarily bother us, since we live there. This might be something like a bathroom that needs to be recaulked, a leak in the garage, broken door handles, and other small things. However, if you’re selling your home, buyers will notice those things right away. They’re easy fixes, so be sure to get those taken care of.

These are all simple ways you can get your house show-ready in time for your appointments. If you have any questions or would like more tips, feel free to reach out to us. We'd be happy to help you.
