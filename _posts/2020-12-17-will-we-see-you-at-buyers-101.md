*Our home-buying seminar is coming up soon, and you’re invited to attend.*

If you are a homebuyer, we’re hosting an upcoming Zoom seminar on January 18 called Purchasing in a Pandemic that will serve as a great way for you to get a leg up on the real estate market. This seminar will be hosted by Sasha Walden, Buyer Specialist for the Dar Walden Team, and Kristen Brown of First Rate Financial. **They’ll outline everything you need to know about the home-buying process.** As a Buyer Specialist, Sasha knows what the market looks like and where to find inventory that’s not even on the market yet.&nbsp;

This seminar is a great way to refresh your knowledge. What happened in the real estate market two years ago isn’t what’s happening now. If you’ve been discouraged by the market lately, we’ll help you get back on track and reach your goal of homeownership. **To register, all you have to do is visit**&nbsp;[**alaskatopagent.com/Pages/Seminar.aspx**](https://www.alaskatopagent.com/Pages/Seminar.aspx){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

We’ll start the seminar at 5:30 p.m. (AKST), and we’ll also be offering gift cards and prizes for all participants. Remember, since this is a virtual event, you can log in anywhere from your computer to attend. The class will only last about an hour, so you’ll get a ton of great information in a short time.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, feel free to call or email us. We’d be happy to help, and we look forward to seeing you on January 18\!
