Today I’m bringing you the latest numbers in the Las Vegas and Henderson area market and wishing all the mothers out there a very Happy Mother’s Day.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report.</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

Before I get started with your newest market update, I want to take a moment to wish all the mothers out there a **Happy Mother’s Day!** Make it a great weekend and enjoy your time with your families. You deserve it!

**Currently, we have a little more than 5,000 single family homes, approximately 400 condos, and around 300 townhomes for sale.** Last month in April, there were 2,800 homes sold. Based on those numbers, we have a very low inventory. In fact, if no new houses came on the market, it would only take 45 days to sell everything currently for sale.

Those numbers put us in a very strong seller’s market. **There are more buyers than there are homes for sale, so prices are going to continue to rise.** If you are thinking about selling, make sure you contact the right agent to help you strategize. Even though it’s a seller’s market, there are certain things you can do to maximize your profit.

If you have any questions about the market conditions or are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help.
