Today, we have a special guest with us: Curry, from Topcat Chimney Service. He’s going to tell you what you need to know when doing a chimney sweep.

A chimney inspection is very thorough. We get up on top of the roof and then go down inside the firebox. We get our head up through the damper, or the flue, and **make sure that there aren’t any cracks or missing pieces in the flue liner.**

Additionally, we make sure there’s a cover, or spark arrestor; that there aren’t unwanted critters living inside your house; and that there isn’t any moisture accumulating inside your chimney.

Whether you use your fireplace or not, **it’s really important to make sure that they chimney is tight. If you’re in need of chimney service, feel free to contact Curry, whose informat**ion can be found on Topcat’s Facebook [**page**](https://www.facebook.com/topcatchimneyservice/).
