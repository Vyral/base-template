<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Join me for a tour of gorgeous Daniel Island, South Carolina.</em></p>

There are so many things to love about Daniel Island life. Daniel Island was built to enjoy the outdoors. With our great parks, trails, and available boat ramps, there is so much on the island.

**For those of you who like shopping and dining, downton Daniel Island is a great place to be.** You can get a nice sit-down dinner at Sermet’s or pick up a pizza from Orlando’s. There’s so much to do.

Daniel Island is also a great place to educate your children from preschool all the way through high school. There is Daniel Island Academy for the little ones, Daniel Island School for K-8, and Bishop England High School.

To keep enjoying the outdoors, Daniel Island has three great public pools: The Pierce Park pool, the Scott Park pool, and the Crow’s Nest. **If you’re looking for something upscale, you can enjoy the Daniel Island club, which has great private pools, tennis courts, and world-class golf courses.**

Finally, every Daniel Islander needs to experience an evening at the Volvo Car Stadium. It hosts many concerts throughout the year as well as professional women’s tennis every year: The Volvo Car Open.&nbsp;

Daniel Island has everything you want and more. If you'd like to explore it for yourself or check out some of the available homes here, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
