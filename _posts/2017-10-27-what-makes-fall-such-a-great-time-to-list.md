Today, I’ve got the top 10 reasons you should list this fall. Let’s start the countdown.

**10. You will have the opportunity to be a cash buyer in the spring.** In the spring, there are more homes available on the market. By listing now, you can sell high and buy low in the spring.

**9. You can restrict showings during the holidays.**

**8. January is when employees start new jobs.** Since transfer employees can’t wait until spring to buy, you’ll need to be on the market at the end of the year to capture these buyers.

**7. People are looking to buy for tax reasons**. Some buyers wait until the end of the year for this reason specifically.

**6. People have more time to look for homes.** Because people often take off work during the holidays, they will be more free to spend time searching the market than other times of year.

**5. Buyers are more emotional**. During the holidays, people become sentimental and may be more likely to pay a higher price.

**4. Houses show better when decorated**. Everyone loves seasonal decor, so homes at this time of year are more attractive.

**3. Supply will dramatically increase in January.** This will lead to less demand, and less demand means less money in your pocket.

**2. Serious buyers have fewer options.** During fall and winter months, there is less competition on the market. This puts your listing at an advantage.

**1. People who look for homes at this time of year are more serious about buying.**
