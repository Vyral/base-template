Today I'm excited to cast the spotlight on a premier local business, Elite Cabinets, and to get to know the story of its owner, Brandon Massey. I also had the opportunity to pick his brain for his advice to those thinking about doing a kitchen remodel.

Right out of high school, Brandon began his trade as a carpenter. From there, he transitioned into finished carpentry, and then to building cabinets in the modern, European-style that Elite Cabinets specializes in today.

Since he began his business four years ago, Brandon has been very busy due to the popularity of his cabinets. In that time, he’s noticed that the market in Tulsa has trended toward modern, clean, simple lines. What’s really cool about Elite Cabinets is that **Brandon’s products can also blend into more rustic, traditional, or craftsman-style homes,** depending on the finishes and wood grain colors.

If you’re planning to remodel your kitchen, Brandon has some advice to offer: **Keep the finishes of the products in mind so that they tie into the aesthetic of your home,** and also think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access (e.g., if you’re right-handed or left-handed).

To make an appointment with Brandon and to learn more about his excellent products, he can be reached at (918) 794-0757 or you can visit his website at **<u><a target="_blank" href="https://elitecabinetstulsa.com/">www.EliteCabinetsTulsa.com</a></u>**.

For any other questions regarding real estate, you are, as always, encouraged to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
