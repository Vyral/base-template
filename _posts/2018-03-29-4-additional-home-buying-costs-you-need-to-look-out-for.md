When buying a home, there are a few costs you need to look for besides PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) to get an idea of what you can really afford.

**1. Utility bills.** You can get an estimate of this cost from [www.mlgw.com](http://www.mlgw.com), and you also have to take into consideration who will be living in the home to get a better idea.

**2. Commuting costs.** What’s the difference location-wise between where you want to live and where you work?

**3. Homeowners association fees.** We have many HOA neighborhoods here in Memphis, and HOA fees aren’t considered part of the payment your lender provides you. These fees can vary quite a bit and can really affect your monthly mortgage payment.

**4. Different credit cards.** When you move in, you’ll receive a lot of different credit cards in the mail from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Sears, and other places, so be careful about signing up for them.
