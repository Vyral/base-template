There’s both good news and bad news to report as we head into September and look back on our market.

The bad news is the market is slowing down and interest rates are rising. If you’re thinking of selling your home, it will probably take you a bit longer to get it sold.

Now, for the good news: In the state of Kentucky, $100 can buy you an average of $113.90 worth of goods. This means **on a national scale, it’s the state with the fifth-lowest cost of living**. On the other end of the spectrum, the least-affordable state to live in is New Jersey, where $100 can only buy you $84.46 worth of goods.
