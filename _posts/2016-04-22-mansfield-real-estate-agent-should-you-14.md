Today, we’ll talk about buying a home with a professional inspection. What should you do in this particular situation in Mansfield?

As a local real estate expert, I always recommend a home inspection. Never buy a home without one! There are a lot of things inside a home an inspector can identity that you cannot. A private contractor will review all the systems in a home, including plumbing and electricity, in addition to checking appliances. There are so many aspects an inspector takes into account when they go through your property.

When you walk through your own home, you won’t be able to detect any problems. Some buyers have more expertise in building and repairing a home. However, the inspector you hire will definitely have that expertise, so you can fix repairs and add upgrades before you even accept an offer. They will always find more than you will just by looking. This is a serious and wise investment that I recommend to anyone selling their home.

I always build in an option period for my buyers. During this period, and inspection will happen along with any negotiations for potential repairs, and the contract can be terminated if necessary. I like to use a seven to ten day period, but ultimately, it’s for your protection. You want to be clear about what you want in the beginning, so there are no surprises later on.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, give me a call or send me an email at your earliest convenience. I’d be happy to help you with any questions you might have!
