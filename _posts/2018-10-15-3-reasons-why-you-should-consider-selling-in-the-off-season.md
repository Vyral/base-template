If you didn’t put your home on the market this summer, don’t worry. Your chance at selling success in 2018 hasn’t passed you by. There are actually three unique benefits sellers can enjoy by listing in the off season.

**1. Buyers in the off-season months tend to be more serious.** During the peak of the market, many buyers are more curious than committed. The buyers that sellers encounter during the off season, meanwhile, are often highly dedicated to striking a deal.

**2. There is less competition in the off season.** In most markets, the majority of homes are sold between April and August. Listing in the off season will therefore allow you to avoid competition while simultaneously enjoying a higher level of demand.

**3. Sellers can reach different demographics in the off-season months.** As you would guess, families with children tend to make their move in the market before the school year begins. Millennials and empty-nesters, though, can be found searching for homes long after the peak summer months.

The bottom line is this: Our off-season market is still full of opportunities for sellers. You don’t have to list during the peak months of the year to be successful. In fact, listing later in the year may be essential to capturing the attention of highly motivated buyers who, like you, delayed their move until the competition subsided.
