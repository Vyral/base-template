Today I’d like to talk about the current value of your home. In Central Ohio, values have been changing dramatically over the last year or so. You’ve probably even looked up your home on a site like Zillow or Redfin to see what your home is worth in today’s market.

However, those algorithms just give you a general estimate of your home’s value. **To find the true value of your home, you need to have a professional real estate agent come out to take a look in person.** They can take into account your home’s location, condition, improvements, and many other things that Zillow won’t.

We’d love to come out and take a look at your home to determine its market value. We can also give you tips on what to do in terms of staging, landscaping, and more that can enhance the home’s value.

**We’re happy to come out and do this free of charge.** You’ll get a free consultation and a market analysis on your specific property. If you want to have us come out and take a look or if you just have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
