<center><em>A word on buying from &lsquo;as is&rsquo; sales.</em></center>

<br>This question has been coming up quite a lot this week because buyers in our seller’s market are so anxious to have their offers on a property accepted. This term is an important part of your negotiations and even after the fact when you’re in contract. **A home that is sold ‘as is’ means the seller intends to sell the house without making repairs**; the property will be sold in its current condition.

If your agent tells you that a home is being sold as is, **you do have the option to have inspections done**. However, the seller should at least attach their disclosures and a pest/roof inspection for you to review. Even during an as-is sale, it’s important to have some kind of understanding about what kind of property you’re buying. It’d be a shame if you got so far into the contract only to find out that the home you were buying has a $10,000 roof issue.

If you have any questions about buying a home in our current market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
