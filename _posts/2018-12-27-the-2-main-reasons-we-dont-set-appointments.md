People always ask us whether we set appointments for our clients. The truth is that this task isn’t part of what we do.

**Our goal as a business is to go after cold traffic so that we can dig up and pre-qualify leads for you.** We generate warm leads and then pass them on to you, but not before making sure that they’re a good prospect. This allows your inside sales staff to get right to work on setting appointments and scaling your business. &nbsp;

There are a couple of reasons why we don’t set appointments. The biggest reason is that **we want you and your staff to be able to pre-qualify each lead for yourself** before going on a meeting with them.

Also, because we’re calling cold traffic, certain leads may be interested but not ready to commit in the near future. It would, therefore, be better for you to put these leads into your CRM and then nurture them until they’re ready.

Your time is valuable, and we know you’re busy. We don’t want you to go on appointments with leads who aren’t entirely qualified or ready to move forward. In short, we aren’t appointment setters—we are outbound prospectors who find warm leads and pass them back to you.
