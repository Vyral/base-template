Spring is here! That means it’s time to start adding some plants around your home. Today, Ryan La Fleur at the Four Seasons Nursery is going to share some tips on the best ways to spruce up your landscaping.

The plants you should choose to add a little pizzaz to your home have to do with timing. **Right now is the best time to plant pretty much anything.** If you get plants from a nursery, you need to keep in mind that they have been babied. Keeping up with the care of those plants is going to take some time and energy.

The good news is, spring allows plants to adapt to their surroundings. Instead of experiencing a major climate change, the weather gradually increases. Spring is like a training period for summer, which means **if you plant them now, your plants will thrive in the hotter weather.**

If you’re selling a home, your plant selection is a little more focused. Although flowers can add a great pop of color for home showings, they will die very quickly and need to be replaced if the home doesn’t sell that particular weekend. **It’s better to buy a plant that offsets the color of your pre-existing landscaping.** For example, if you have green bushes, get a few plants with red or gold in them that will stay that color. You won’t have to replace them as often, and you still get a great pop of color.
