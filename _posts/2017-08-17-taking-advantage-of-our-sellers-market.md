Conditions in our market have aligned to greatly favor sellers, so if you’ve been thinking about listing your home, now might be the time to do it.

<div class="post-cta">
<strong><a href="http://www.searchwilmingtonhomevalues.com/" target="_blank">How much would your Wilmington home sell for in today's market?</a></strong>

</div>

If you’ve given any thought to selling your home in the next year, you might want to consider putting your home on the market right now.

According to a recent study by the National Association of Realtors, **there are still a lot of buyers in our market, but there aren’t a lot of homes available for purchase.** Any time buyers outpace the supply of inventory, it creates a seller’s market.

As a seller, these conditions give you more negotiation power when it comes to what offer you accept on your home and how you dictate the terms of that offer. They can also affect how many repairs you need to make on your home before you put it on the market.

If you have any questions about the current state of our market or you’re thinking of about buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help.
