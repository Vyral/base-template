<div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Contrary to popular belief, mortgage insurance can benefit you greatly as a consumer, and here are the three different types you need to know about. *<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">To many people, the topic of mortgage insurance carries a negative connotation, but it shouldnt. It has its place in the mortgage process and can benefit you as a consumer. There are three main types of mortgage insurance you need to be aware of. 

<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Know the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The most common type is **borrower-paid monthly **mortgage insurance. This is where the monthly amount gets added to the principal and interest portion of your payment. You would then make that payment each month until you get to a 78% loan-to-value ratio. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The other type is **single-premium financed** mortgage insurance. This is where the lifetime costs of the mortgage insurance get financed into the loan amount. It keeps your interest rate the same, but it adds to the loan amount. This actually results in a lower monthly payment because you dont have the interest rate at that higher amount each month. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The last type is **lender-paid **mortgage insurance. This is where the lender pays the lifetime cost of the mortgage insurance in exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate has a negative connotation with most consumers, but the reality is that it results in the lowest possible monthly payment, and its even lower once you consider the after-tax mortgage interest deduction. This is a good way to structure your loan, but not if youre going to keep the loan for a very long time. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The benefit of the monthly mortgage insurance is that it can fall off once you get to the 78% loan-to-value ratio. If you finance it in as a lump sum into the loan amount or roll it into the interest rate, theres nothing to fall off because it has already been factored in. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The rules to remove monthly insurance are pretty complicated, and which structure makes the most sense for you is largely dependent on your goals for your property. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
