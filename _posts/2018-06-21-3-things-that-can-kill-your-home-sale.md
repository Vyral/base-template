You may think that your house is ready to go on the market as-is, but little things you would not expect can end up being big deal-breakers for buyers. This is why today I want to take a look at three silly things that could sabotage your home sale if you don’t fix them:

**1. A messy lawn.** Buyers likely won’t forgive a messy lawn. Your home may even stand out if a buyer sees you making an effort to clean it up while your neighbor’s yard is still 15 inches deep in leaves.

**2. Animals.** While buyers may not mind if animals live in the home that they are considering purchasing, they don’t want to see or smell any evidence of them.

**3. Cords hanging from a mounted TV.** Do not be surprised if a potential buyer’s eyes go straight to the dangling cords as they walk in. At that point, they’re going to wonder why you did not take the extra steps to hide those cords.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. And, if you are thinking of selling your home, please call or email anytime. I would be happy to help.
