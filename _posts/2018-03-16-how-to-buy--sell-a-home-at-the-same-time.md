How do you sell your home and buy another home without being homeless in between?<br><br>Whether you are moving up from a townhome or condo to a single-family property or downsizing, this can be a tricky transition.&nbsp;<br><br>Basically, you will need to use the home of choice contingency in the standard contract. So, if you have a property to sell and the buyer makes an offer, you can tell the buyer that you will accept the offer as long as they give you enough time to find the home of your choice. You can ask for two weeks, two months, 60 daysâ€”it all depends on the buyer.
