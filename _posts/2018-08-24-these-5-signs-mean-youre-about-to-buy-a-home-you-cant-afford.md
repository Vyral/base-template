<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are five sure signs you need to watch out for as a homebuyer that indicate you’re about to purchase something you can’t afford.</em></p>

If you’re about to purchase a home, here are the five signs you need to watch out for that indicate you might be buying something you can’t afford:&nbsp;

**1. Your loan program looks like a trail mix of mortgages.** If this is the case, you might be getting too deep into the financial side of things. “First mortgage,” “second mortgage,” “adjustable rate,” 80-20 loan,” “extended terms,” and “balloon payment” are common terms you’ll hear in these types of situations. The most common mortgages are the FHA, VA, conventional, and Alaska Housing Finance Corporation loans.&nbsp;

**2. You need a down payment assistance program.** If you qualify for one of these, you might be overextending yourself.&nbsp;

**3. You only have just enough money to cover the down payment.** Oftentimes, lenders will approve you for way more than what you should buy, so you need to be careful of that. If they approve your for $400,000, that doesn’t mean you should buy at $400,000. If you can afford to, that’s great, but don’t feel bad about capping your purchase price.

**4. You need to borrow from your retirement program.** Keep saving your money and buy when the time is right.&nbsp;

**5. Your gut instinct says “no.”** If you’re nervous about the purchase because you think the payments are going to be too high, odds are they will be.&nbsp;
