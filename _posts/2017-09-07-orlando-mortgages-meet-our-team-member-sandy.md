Meet Sandy Tolen, a loan processor on our team.

**Sandy has worked with us for just over a year and a half, but has been in the mortgage industry for more than 15 years.**

As a loan processor, Sandy reviews documents provided by the borrowers to ensure that they meet underwriting guidelines.

She also works directly with the underwriters throughout the process to help loans be approved.

Sandy notes, also, that it is a common misconception that all loans are the same. In her role, **she encounters and handles a variety different circumstances.**

The most rewarding part about her work on our team, though, is being able to get people into homes. This is what she says is her favorite part of her job.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
