It’s summertime in the City of Roses. What does that mean besides a hot real estate market? For my family, it means vacation. We just got back from a week in Cabo. It was our last hurrah before my daughter starts her “real” job after graduating from college.

While we were there, we wanted to find the best places to eat, the best drinks, and the best beaches. We had no idea where to go, so we found an expert to guide us.
