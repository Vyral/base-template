Today I’m joined by a very special guest, Travis from VIP Roofing, to help me discuss roofing inspections and certifications.&nbsp;

So, what is a roofing certification? Ultimately, a roofing certification gives you a document verifying the condition of your roof. It will give you an idea of any current issues, as well as things you may be able to do to extend the life of your roof.

This certification is something that will often be requested by FHA appraisers. These appraisers will look at things like the ventilation systems, as well as for any balding spots. **These shiny, “bald” patches on the roof are actually where fiberglass is coming through** due to age or lack of ventilation.&nbsp;

From the perspective of a seller or homeowner, it’s a really good idea to have a company like VIP Roofing come out. Roofing inspections can really give you a good idea of how your roof can be improved, and also how long you can expect it to last. People like Travis will also help you to identify ways you might be able to extend the life of your roof.&nbsp;

**Roofing inspections are a little bit more in depth than a roofing certification.**During an inspection, the inspector is going to look for problem areas. Sometimes this can involve lifting a few shingles, pulling back some siding, or otherwise examining the roof beyond simply looking at it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

Having a lot of past experience, Travis and his team know what to look for when they’re searching for problems with a roof. We here at the Stern Team trust VIP Roofing as a quality, local vendor.

Certain issues can cause roofs to deteriorate much faster than they should. **One key issue Travis pointed out is poor attic ventilation**. One way to help with this is by installing a turtle vent, which allows the attic to breathe. The difference between good and poor ventilation could be the difference between a roof lasting for 30 years instead of lasting for seven.

Another factor that can cause roofs to deteriorate more quickly is when shingles are layered on top of each other.

Our local climate is incredibly harsh. **From extreme heat in the summer to below freezing in the winter, the roof can see a lot of damage.**

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, roofing is more important than you might think to Salt Lake City real estate. VIP Roofing is a great place to go to make sure your roof will actually last.
