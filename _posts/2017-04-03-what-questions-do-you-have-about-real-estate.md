Today I’m excited to announce my **new real estate video blog!**

**I’ll be sending you two educational videos a month** that have to do with all things real estate. They will feature tips on the local real estate market and answers to any questions you may have about home buying, home selling, or investing in real estate.

I’ll also touch on what’s going on in the lending and title world as well.

However, this new blog is a resource for you, so **I want to know what questions you would like me to answer in these videos.** Are you curious about the market in your particular area? Are there any topics you would like me touch on, or terms in real estate that you are unfamiliar with? Let me know what you would like to learn about and I will be happy to answer any and all of your real estate questions.

I can’t wait to start answering your questions in my video blog, but in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
