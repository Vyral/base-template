{% include youtube.html %}I’ve got some really exciting news to share today. As most of you know, I’ve been practicing real estate for a little over 10 years and I’ve recently decided to start sharing some of my expertise with you through a real estate video blog. I wanted to make sure I included all of you.

Each month, I’ll be sending out two emails addressing trends in our local real estate market. I’ll also be touching on changes in the lending world and providing you with tips to navigate this wonderful world of real estate.

Rather than simply guess what’s on your mind, I wanted to reach out to you and find out what you have specific questions about. Are there concepts that confuse you? Do you have specific questions about a neighborhood or area? If you have a question, there is probably someone out there with a similar question. If you have one, reach out to me and I’ll do my best to answer the question via video so someone else who has that question can hear the answer too.

If you have any questions at all about buying or selling real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
