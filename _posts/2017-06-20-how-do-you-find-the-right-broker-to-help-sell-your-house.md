When hiring a real estate broker, there are a few specific things you should look for.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**Experience** is the first and most important thing you want to look for. Like hiring a surgeon, you want someone who is ready for anything that could come your way during the process. Hopefully the transaction is easy, smooth, and profitable for everybody, but that doesn't always happen. Be sure you're in capable hands in case anything surprising comes up.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Next, consider **the overall likability of the agent.** Are they someone you could work with day in and day out? Could you still work with them if things start going sideways? You want someone who can reassure you that you're in good hands when you start getting nervous or tense about all the moving parts.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>You should also **find out about the size of the broker's team.** Do they have one or more assistants and a team of buyer's agents around them who can support them in finding a buyer for your house? Or, will they do it all on their own? If they're flying solo, the personal attention can be great, but they have to do a heck of a lot of work all for one person without the support of a team. This can cause efficiency to break down.
