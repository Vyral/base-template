Today, we’ll be going over the most recent market numbers for our local area. To help, I’ve brought on a very special guest—my oldest daughter Taylor Sabato.

We’ll be comparing several factors in terms of how things looked last year versus how they are right now. In just a year’s worth of time, the market has changed quite a bit.

In June of 2016, we had 4.7 month’s supply of inventory. For those of you who don’t know, **month’s supply of inventory is one of the most important factors in our market.** This factor can drive supply up or down.

Simply put, the month’s supply of inventory refers to the time it would take for every home currently on the market to sell if no new homes were listed.

Since last year, this number has gone up. This June we had 5.1 month’s supply of inventory. According to experts, six months of inventory is considered a balanced market. Anything lower is a seller’s market, whereas anything higher indicates a buyer’s market.

Right now, this means **we are still slightly in the range of a seller’s market.**

So how many new home listings actually came on the market as of June of 2016? This time last year, 257 single-family homes were listed on the market. This year, however, we had 314 new home listings—an increase of about 22% from last June.

**This growth is what caused the month’s of supply to increase, making our market more balanced overall.**

The number of closings has also increased since last year. In June of 2016 we saw 252 closings compared to this year’s 274. That’s an increase of 8.7%.

All of these factors are intertwined. Looking at the numbers, it isn’t hard to see how they’re correlated.

This update was just a broad overview, but if you have any more specific questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
