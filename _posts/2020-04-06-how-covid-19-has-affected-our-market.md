Today this video comes to you from my walk because, as many of us with kids are discovering, we need to get creative to find quiet spaces. This is, of course, not the spring market we anticipated and we're revved up for. **Real estate has slowed significantly during the health crisis**, and it appears it may stay that way for the foreseeable future.

We believe it might take some time for people’s priorities to shift again after this is all over.
