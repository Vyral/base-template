When you buy a home, you have the right to do a final walkthrough of the home before closing. This helps you ensure that the property is still in the same condition as when you bought it.&nbsp;

**Typically, the final walkthrough is done on the morning of the closing date or a few days before.** The buyer and their agent walk through the home, turn on faucets, flush toilets, and check for dings and scratches on floors and walls. We also walk around the outside and make sure the condition hasn’t changed. Additionally, we ensure that any agreed-upon items are still in the home.&nbsp;

In our current market, however, we’re seeing some strange things happening with walkthroughs—particularly with buyers who choose not to get inspections. The final walkthrough isn’t a last-minute inspection that lets buyers request fixes; it’s only to make sure the property hasn’t substantially changed.

We’ve had situations where the buyer noticed the seller replaced high-quality plumbing fixtures with cheap ones, and we’ve also seen sellers leave piles of trash and debris in the home. In another case, the seller still had a renter living in the property on the day of the walkthrough. **These are examples of why it’s important to do the final walkthrough**, as once you close on a property, you’ve accepted it in its current condition.
