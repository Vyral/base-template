To answer the question of how much home you can afford, we need to take into account a few primary items. Your household income, monthly debts, and the amount of savings you have for a down payment are three of the biggest.&nbsp;

**As a homebuyer, you want to have a certain level of comfort with your monthly mortgage payment.** While your household income and monthly debts may be relatively stable, unexpected expenses and unplanned spending can impact your savings. A good rule of thumb is to have three months’ worth of payments in savings to allow you to cover your mortgage in the case of an emergency.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
