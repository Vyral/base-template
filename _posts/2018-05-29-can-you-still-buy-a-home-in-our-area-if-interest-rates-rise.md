We’ve seen rates increase already this year, and the buzz is that they’ll be rising once more. **Currently, they’re sitting at around 4.75%, but they’re expected to rise as high as 5% by the end of 2018.**

What does this mean for buyers’ purchasing power?

To give you an example, imagine you’re buying a $200,000 home with 10% down. At a rate of 4.75%, you’d have a monthly principal and interest payment of $938.97. At a 5% rate, that same payment would increase to $966.28. In other words, if rates go up by 0.25%, you’d pay $27 more each month.

So in reality, **this rise is nothing to sweat over**. From a historical perspective, rates are still very low. It’s also a good sign that rates are going up because that means our economy is doing better.

So, if you’re renting and considering buying a home, remember that you can still purchase one affordably, especially in our Hays County area. In fact, buying a home would be cheaper than renting. In any case, be sure to talk to a mortgage professional before you do anything.
