Do you find yourself caught in analysis paralysis—the feeling of overanalyzing what needs to happen in your business or life? Many of us have felt this way, so today I’d like to talk about how to overcome this feeling. Analysis paralysis is particularly common in our industry. People become so focused on analyzing their next step forward that they’re unable to actually move on.

**Having big goals and dreams is great, but it’s important to not let analysis paralysis prevent you from taking immediate action.** For example, I was at lunch with a good friend of mine the other day who told me he just couldn’t understand why he wasn’t moving forward. He had a big vision, but hasn't been able to progress toward that goal.

When he told me about this problem, I was reminded of my own struggle from my past. Years ago, I was undergoing a huge shift in my career. This shift gave me a lot of anxiety. Instead of moving forward, I spent all my time analyzing my next move.

One day, I took some time off and visited an art gallery. As I saw one piece in particular, the image really hit home with me. I still have this piece of art today. The image is of a man walking through the dark with a torch. In the background of the painting, there’s something barely visible that appears to be the man’s goal.

I really identified with this painting. **Just like the man in the painting, I was able to see my immediate surroundings, but couldn’t quite make out the end goal in the distance.** I knew something better was out there, but I would need to cross a chasm of darkness to get there. This fear of the unknown is what holds us back.

Fear can keep us in a state of analysis paralysis. Thankfully, you can overcome it. The first thing you need is to have a sense of clarity around your vision. This doesn’t mean you need to have a perfect sense of the future, but you should have a clear goal.

**The next step in overcoming analysis paralysis is to identify what’s “five feet in front of you.”** Thinking back to the painting, the man with the torch could only see about five feet ahead of where he was going. You need to know what steps are in your immediate future. Then, you’ll need to move onto the third step: Take massive action.

The only wrong action is inaction. Sitting and overanalyzing your situation instead of taking any action won’t get you anywhere. When you actually take action, you’ll find that the light from your “torch” will cast out to the next “five feet” of your journey, which weren’t visible before you made that action.

At this point, it’s time to recalibrate. Make sure you’re headed in the right direction, then repeat the first three steps. Keep repeating these steps until you reach your goal. What I love about this method is that you are always moving forward. When I first saw this painting and got inspired, I didn’t know what was ahead of me. I chipped away toward my goal a little at a time. **The dim light that represented my goal became brighter and brighter as I progressed forward.** &nbsp;Using this method, you can beat your analysis paralysis and move forward, too.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
