How does hitting your target audience fit into the seven components of a business plan?

First of all, your target audience isn’t an “audience” so much as it’s who you’re marketing to and what kind of customer you’re trying to attract.

If you’re going after move-up buyers and Roanoke’s average sale price is $180,000 but you’re showing houses in the $325,000-and-above range, you won’t hit your target market. &nbsp;Every office has a $500,000 house that they need to list in order to make a seller happy. **If your target market is your average move-up buyer and you keep showing half-million-dollar homes, you’re not doing yourself any favors** because most buyers in that price range already have an agent.

If you sell that home, that’s great, but you won’t accumulate buyers the way you would if you hosted open houses in the $180,000 range.

The point is, know your target audience and stay on task. Like I said in my last video, we’re all squirrel chasers, but you can’t lose sight of where you were and the direction you’re going.
