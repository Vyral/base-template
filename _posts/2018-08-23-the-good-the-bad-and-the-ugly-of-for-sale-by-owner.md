Today I want to discuss some of the risks of selling your home as for sale by owner.

**FSBO sellers are probably having more success now than ever.** In fact, The National Association of Realtors says that a little over 5% of FSBO properties are successful. Although they are selling successfully, most of them are selling for 5% to 10% less than they would have if they were sold by an agent who could’ve marketed the home and generated foot traffic.&nbsp;

Most FSBO properties attract unqualified buyers, which means you’ll have people who are not pre-qualified walking through your home. They also attract tire-kickers and people who are looking for owner financing. Or, you could just attract people who will steal your things.

Recently here in Charlotte, we had a home seller who let a random couple come and see their house. During their time in the house, the couple unlocked a couple windows. They later broke in and robbed the owners when they were out of town, stealing all of their valuables.&nbsp;

**If you’re selling your home as for sale by owner, congratulations on taking the initiative to do it by yourself.** But, be careful not to leave 10% to 15% of the purchase price on the table, because it could end up costing you $20,000, $30,000, or even $40,000+ depending on the price range.&nbsp;
