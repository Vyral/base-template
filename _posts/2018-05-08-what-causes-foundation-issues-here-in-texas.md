In Texas, our soil can cause a host of issues for the foundations of our homes. This is because **our soil is made up of clay, not dirt, and can therefore crush foundations as it expands and contracts.**

Originally when homes were built in Texas, they were built on bois d’arc or cinder blocks. This technique kept homes elevated and allowed homeowners to shim their properties as the clay expanded and contracted. Of course as time went on, solutions to foundation issues in Texas evolved.

In the 70s, people began building slabs. But because these slabs cracked easily, post-tension foundations became popular in the 80s and are still the prevalent choice for homes today. Another option you will occasionally find is a pier and beam foundation.

Pier and beam foundations, which are typically used for custom or luxury properties, are set in several feet of concrete.

Whether you’re a buyer, a seller, or a homeowner, it’s very important to know the signs of a damaged foundation. **Things like cracking around the door and window frames and a stair-step pattern in brick exteriors are indicators of foundation issues.**
