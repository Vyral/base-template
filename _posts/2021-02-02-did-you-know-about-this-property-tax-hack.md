<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Make sure to file for your homeowners exemption if you haven’t yet.</em></p>

Today I have a quick tip for reducing your property taxes this year. A lot of new homeowners are unaware of the homeowners exemption, which will save you approximately $70 per year on your property taxes. If you have bought a home and it is your primary residence, you can apply. **All you need to do is fill out <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://assessor.lacounty.gov/homeowners-exemption/">this form</a></u>, send it in, and start saving.**

If you have any questions for me about the homeowners exemption or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
