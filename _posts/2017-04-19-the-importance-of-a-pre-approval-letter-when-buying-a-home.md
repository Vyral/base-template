{% include youtube.html %}When you buy a home, a letter of pre-approval from your mortgage lender is a key tool you want to have. I'm joined today by Jeff Peer of Fidelity Mortgage to help me explain why.

As Jeff points out, the pre-approval process takes just a couple minutes and is very easy. All you need is a couple pieces of information and Jeff will take a look at your credit and run the numbers. There's no cost involved for you.

**Getting pre-approved for a mortgage will be the first step any real estate agent will want you to go through.**If 2017 is anything like last year, this step will be important so you can get a jump on a house when you're ready to make an offer. Homes will probably be flying off the shelves like they did in 2016.
