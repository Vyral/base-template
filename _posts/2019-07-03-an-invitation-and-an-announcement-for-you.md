I have a couple of really exciting announcements to make today.

First, I wanted to invite you to our annual customer appreciation event at Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park as the Charleston Riverdogs take on the West Virginia Power on August 21 at 7:05 p.m. This is a massive fundraiser for us and we’ve been able to raise a lot of money in the past through inviting all of our friends and clients to the game.

**For every person who RSVPs through us, we’ll not only give you a free ticket to the game, but we’ll also donate $5 on your behalf to the MUSC children’s burn fund.** Bring anyone and everyone you want,&nbsp;[but make sure to RSVP here to reserve their spots\! We can’t wait to see you there.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCKsW3Lqx7cu2dbFGArdvh_HwFUD9wvXtERdP_KAz8ZQuD6w/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1){: target="_blank"}

**My second big announcement is that we've welcomed two new team members: Lynette and Jonathan &nbsp;— &nbsp;the newest listing specialists at the Dave Friedman Team.&nbsp;**They’re excited to continue their career here as listing specialists on the team. These are two great additions to our team and we couldn’t be more excited to have them. I can’t tell you how lucky we are to add this combined 20 years of experience in the industry to our already-stellar team.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or if you have any real estate needs that we can assist with, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
