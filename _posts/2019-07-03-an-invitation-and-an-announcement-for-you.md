I have a couple of really exciting announcements to make today.

First, I wanted to invite you to our annual customer appreciation event at Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park as the Charleston Riverdogs take on the West Virginia Power on August 21 at 7:05 p.m. This is a massive fundraiser for us and we’ve been able to raise a lot of money in the past through inviting all of our friends and clients to the game.

For every person who RSVPs through us, we’ll not only give you a free ticket to the game, but we’ll also donate $5 on your behalf to the MUSC children’s burn fund. Bring anyone and everyone you want, but make sure to RSVP here to reserve their spots\! We can’t wait to see you there.

The second big announcement I have is to introduce you to Lynette and Jonathan, the newest listing specialists at the Dave Friedman Team. They’re excited to continue their career here as a listing specialist on the team. These are two great additions to our team and we couldn’t be more excited to have them. I can’t tell you how lucky we are to add this combined 20 years of experience in the industry to our already-stellar team.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or if you have any real estate needs that we can assist with, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
