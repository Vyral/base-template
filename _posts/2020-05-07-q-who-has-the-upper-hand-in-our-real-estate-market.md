<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ve got some fantastic news for anyone thinking of selling their home.</em></p>

I have a very important message for you today. If you’ve been thinking about buying or selling a house anytime in the near future, now may be the ideal time. If you’ve been on the fence, here’s what you should know. Over the last 30 days, 2,470 properties have come on our market and 4,712 properties have gone under contract.

Right now homes are selling like crazy, demand remains very strong, and you can take advantage of that fact and get top dollar by selling your home. To learn more about what’s going on, watch this short video.
