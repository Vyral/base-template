Selling a home is a major milestone in life, and the consequences of making a mistake can impact your finances and peace of mind for years to come. To help you avoid this stress, today I’ll discuss the three most common mistakes to avoid when you’re selling your home:

**Mistake No. 1: Failing to understand the costs of selling.&nbsp;**The total cost of selling a home can amount to even more than the 6% in agent commissions that most people pay. When you account for closing costs, repairs, and other concessions to the buyer, the cost of selling could be closer to 10% of the sales price.

**Mistake No. 2: Setting an unrealistic price.**&nbsp;The price you want to get and the price the market is willing to pay can be two very different numbers. As a seller, if you can’t hit the sweet spot between the two, you risk leaving money on the table or having your home sit on the market for a long time, which can reduce how much you ultimately net. Your agent can help you find that sweet spot.

**Mistake No. 3: Not preparing your home for sale.**&nbsp;One challenge of listing your home on the market is showing it to prospective buyers. Generally speaking, the cleaner, less cluttered, and better decorated your home is, the more appealing it will be, and the more buyers will be prepared to pay for it.
