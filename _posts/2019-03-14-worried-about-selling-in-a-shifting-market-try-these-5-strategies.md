During the last five to seven years, homes were selling quickly and for top dollar—often in spite of their condition or location—because supply was low and demand was through the roof.

&nbsp;Now, this trend has reversed: Supply is much higher and demand is dropping as a result. We’re currently facing a (quite normal) adjustment to our real estate market. However, despite the commonplace nature of this change, the question of how to sell a home in a shifting market still remains. There are five main ways to do so:

**1. Price it right from day one.** Overpricing a home in today’s market greatly diminishes your odds of selling. Buyers determine value by comparison shopping, so make sure your property is similarly priced to other area homes with the same features and benefits. View your property through the eyes of a buyer, and consider whether you would see it as a good deal if you were in their shoes.&nbsp;

**2. Make sure its condition is nearly perfect.** As inventory rises, buyers have a greater level of choice. Do not go to market until your home is in good enough condition to compete with other listings. Properties that are priced right and in great condition will always sell first.

**3. Adjust your price so that you are No. 1 or No. 2 in the market.** If your property hasn’t sold within the first 14 to 21 days of listing, it’s time to adjust your price. The longer you’re on the market, the worse your chances of selling become.&nbsp;

**4. Consider using a reverse offer.** If your property has been shown to a qualified, motivated buyer, submitting a reverse offer could be a good idea.&nbsp;

**5. Consider offering buyer concessions to trigger an offer.** Paying six months’ to one year's worth of taxes, paying for the buyer’s closing costs, or offering some other concession may be the final push you need to get your home sold.&nbsp;
