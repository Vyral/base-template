When you buy a home and get to the closing table, an attorney is going to look at you and ask, “Would you like owner’s title insurance?”

Nine times out of 10, **buyers in this circumstance will look at their Realtor thinking, “What should I do?”** Obviously, the choice is ultimately in your hands. But there are a few points to consider before making a decision.

First, it is important to know what title insurance is. Title insurance essentially insures the property’s title against defects. In other words, if someone has a claim against the title of your property, title insurance will protect your interest and equity in the property.

**Banks believe title insurance is important to protecting their interests, so why shouldn’t you also seek this same protection?**

Nevertheless, most people do not go forward with purchasing title insurance. But, personally, I do. It is a lot cheaper to buy title insurance on the front end than to pay attorneys several hundreds of dollars (or more) down the line to clean up a title dispute.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
