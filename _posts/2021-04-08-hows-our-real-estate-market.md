Just how hot is our real estate market? **If a listing that’s priced well and in reasonable shape comes onto the market, it’s gone almost immediately.** We’re seeing between 10 and 20 buyers for every listing, so if you’ve been considering selling, now is the time. The other day we listed a home at $265,000, but we already received four offers in just the coming-soon stage—they hadn’t even seen the house in person.&nbsp;

All that means we need inventory. Nearly every property listed at $350,000 and under will draw multiple offers, and homes above that price point still have multiple-offer potential. If you’re thinking about selling but are concerned about where you’ll move afterward, you need a team of agents who will prospect in every neighborhood you’re interested in to find the right house.

**We need to establish a game plan.** We’ll take photos, do 3D imaging, and make a Matterport virtual tour so people can walk through your home virtually. We need to have all that ready so that you’re prepared to sell when we find the right house for you to buy. You’ll likely get a better deal, sell your property in a more reasonable amount of time, and the transition will be simple. Get the best deal possible while interest rates are still very low.&nbsp;

If you know anyone looking to buy or sell real estate, **keep us in mind.** Also, if you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, call or email us. We look forward to speaking with you.
