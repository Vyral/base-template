Should you sell your home during the holidays?

I’ve been asked this question about four or five times in the last couple of weeks. This is a seller question but if you are serious about putting your home on the market, you need to consider things from the buyer’s perspective.

**B******uyers**who are looking for a home during the holidays tend to be more serious**. They have more time off work to look at homes, and they tend to be very emotional around Christmas and Thanksgiving. Going into escrow during this time can be very emotional for buyers. It’s a great time for them to get into a new home and celebrate the holidays with their family.

If you are looking to sell, that can be emotional as well. Your life will be interrupted when your home is on the market. We want to get as many showings for your property as possible. If you plan on having friends and family over for the holidays and you don’t want to be interrupted, then by all means, wait until the new year to put your home on the market.

If you don’t mind being bombarded by buyer traffic, then **the holidays are a great time to sell your home**. Most of the people we talk to wait until January or February to get in the market, so there is less inventory and less competition for sellers during the holidays. As we mentioned, buyers tend to be more serious during the holiday market as well.

That said, if you do sell your home during the holidays, you don’t want to take the first offer. Let your listing mature. Wait eight or 10 days so that any buyers who were out of town for the holidays have a chance to see it. Once your home has been properly exposed to the market, then you can accept an offer.

If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
