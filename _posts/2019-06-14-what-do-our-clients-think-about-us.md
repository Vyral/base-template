Today’s message is very special. Why? Well, instead of telling you ourselves what makes Jeff Cook Real Estate so great, we brought on a past client to describe her experience working with our team. Justa Tumminia heard about us from a friend of hers who had already worked with us in the past, and so even though she wasn’t entirely sure she was ready to make a move, she decided to give us a try. And, as you’ll hear her say in her testimonial, she was extremely glad she did. We were able to to help her settle on her goals and, once her mind was made up, we got her property under contract within 24 hours of sticking a sign in the yard. “You're not only getting a professional agent \[…\] you’re also getting a family,” says Justa Tumminia. “You’ve got a whole team behind you.” To hear Justa Tumminia’s full testimonial, watch this short video. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
