Today's message is very special. Why? Well, instead of telling you ourselves what makes Jeff Cook Real Estate so great, we brought on a past client to describe her experience working with our team. Justa Tumminia heard about us from another past client, who was a friend of hers. Justa wasn't entirely sure she was ready to sell her home but decided to give us a try. And, as you'll hear her say in her testimonial, she was extremely glad she did. We were able to help her clarify her goals and, once her mind was made up to sell, we got her property under contract within 24 hours of sticking a sign in the yard. "You're not only getting a professional agent \[...\] you're also getting a family," says Justa Tumminia. "You've got a whole team behind you." To hear Justa Tumminia's full testimonial, watch this short video.&nbsp;
