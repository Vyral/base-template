Today I wanted to take a minute to tell you all about our Guaranteed Sale Program.

Since we’re currently in a seller’s market, this isn’t something that has been coming into play all that often. Nevertheless, I wanted to give you an idea of what it is and how it works. **I personally like to give sellers what I think are the pros and cons of their situation**, and what the best and worst-case scenarios are in any given circumstance.

Even though I like to provide this information and feedback, I still want to give sellers the freedom to choose their own initial list price—within reason. Still, a lot of sellers ask me what I would do if I were in their shoes.

This is where the Guaranteed Sale Program comes into play. This program lets me put my money where my mouth is.

If the seller lists their home at a price my team and I recommend and agree with and doesn’t sell within 30 days, the listing will undergo an agreed-upon price reduction. This reduction is usually about 3%. **If the listing still doesn’t sell within 60 days, we will continue to market your property at no cost.** Though we’ll still need to pay the buyer’s agent, my team and I will basically be working for free at that point.

This guarantee does not include short sales or tenant-occupied properties, and there needs to be equity in the property.

Pre-appraisals and pre-inspections are both required for the Guaranteed Sale Program.

This allows us to be totally transparent with any potential buyers. This also allows us to take care of any issues that arise in the report ahead of time. **With a pre-inspection, a lot of surprises are taken out of the transaction.**

The program also requires that you meet with our in-house stager Rose, and agree to any of her recommendations.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
