<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why it behooves buyers to call sooner than later in today’s market.</em></p>

Oftentimes we hear from people who say they’re looking to buy in four months, so they’ll just plan to meet with us then; while that’s totally fine (we can meet with people whenever), we’ve found that **the more prepared you are for the future purchase, the better.&nbsp;**

To work with us and have us help you buy, it doesn’t cost you anything. All of our services to help you prepare for the purchase are free. On several occasions we had clients who assumed they were ready to buy but discovered they had a credit issue, or some additional documentation was needed for their pre-approval that took a while to gather.&nbsp;

Even if you don’t plan on buying for some months, it’s good to meet with us now so we can get you connected with a lender; doing so will help you figure out approximately what your purchase price is—you may be surprised at what you’re able to afford, or you may be left saying, “Wow, I won’t be able to afford what I thought I would.”&nbsp;

For the latter case, **you’ll have ample time to come up with creative solutions.** For example, you could acquire a loan with a family as a co-signer so you can maximize your purchase price.&nbsp;

Call us and set up a time to meet with us and we’ll help you look through everything. We’ll tailor our solutions to your unique situation and prepare you fully so that when it comes time to act, there will be no surprises.&nbsp;

As the old adage goes, “Those who fail to prepare, prepare to fail.” Reach out at any time, we love hearing from you and helping however we can.
