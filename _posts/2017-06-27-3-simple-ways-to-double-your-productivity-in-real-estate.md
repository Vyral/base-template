We can’t control the amount of time we have as real estate agents, but we can control how we spend that time. I’m here to tell you that if you can improve that control, you can double your productivity.

To do this, you need to focus on the actions and tasks that give you the highest return on the investment of your time. **These are activities like following up with leads and prospecting.** They are very important, but we often don’t treat them that way. We tend to procrastinate on them.

To manage your time more wisely, I recommend using activity blocking to make sure you have specific times set aside in your calendar each day where you can focus on those money-making activities. As you can see in my calendar in the video above, I have time set aside each day for specific tasks and time set aside for focusing on things other than work. Here are my three steps to doubling your productivity:

**1. Block time out in your schedule each day where you are specifically not working.**

**2. Block time out in the morning for a specific task, whether it be prospecting, business building, or something else.**

**3. Protect those time blocks with a vengeance.**

By following these three steps, you can use the remaining time in your schedule to accomplish the rest of the things you need to do. Setting up your schedule like this will ensure you devote plenty of time to the right things.

If you have any questions for me about your career or you just want to have a quick conversation about the business, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
