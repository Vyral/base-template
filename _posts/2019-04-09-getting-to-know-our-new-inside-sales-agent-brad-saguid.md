For today’s video, we’re placing the spotlight on **our newest inside sales agent, Bradley Saguid,** and he’ll share a little about his background and what ultimately led him to Team Lally.&nbsp;

Bradley first cracked into the business by working in the vacation ownership vein of real estate for two years. When he and his family moved to Makakilo here in Oahu a few months ago, he began keeping a close eye on some of the top agents on the island and discovered Team Lally.&nbsp;

Once he felt settled in Makakilo, he mustered the courage to attend one of our career nights. Bradley was struck by our presentation and the way we operate and, from there, a rapport was born. **He expressed a desire to face the challenge right from the start and became a new team member not long after!&nbsp;**

His motivation stemmed from his determination to be a part of an elite group and to have the chance to work alongside other team members that set the standard and perform at a high professional level day in and day out.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}

As mentioned, Bradley’s role is as an inside sales agent with Team Lally. **He’s tasked with helping families understand the early stages of the home buying process, not the least of which is the pre-approval.** To that end, he works in close collaboration with the No. 1 mortgage company in Oahu, Pacific Rim. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

You can expect Bradley to answer when you call in regard to our Sunday open houses. **His job is to direct you to the buyer’s agent or listing specialist that is right for you.&nbsp;**

At Team Lally, each of us works to hone our specific skills and deliver the best possible service to you, which allows for greater cohesion and a track record of success. As Bradley points out, 'I look at Team Lally as the all-star team. Everyone masters what they’re given, and we all work efficiently.'

If you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, give Brad and the team a call to get the conversation started. We look forward to hearing from you!
