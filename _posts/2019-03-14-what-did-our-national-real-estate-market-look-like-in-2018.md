Now that we’re well into the new year, let’s take a look at how our real estate market performed in 2018.

Now that we’re well into the new year, it’s time to take a look back at how our local real estate market performed, overall, in 2018.

First, let’s look at some data regarding buyer demographics. **In 2018, 33% of all people who bought a home were first-time buyers.** Though there was an influx of millennials in our marketplace last year, the average age of buyers was 46, and the average age of sellers was 55.&nbsp;

Also, 12% of home sales were multi-generational. This includes adult children with aging parents, and also parents with adult children who have moved back in.&nbsp;

**Of all homes sold, 86% were resale properties and 14% were new construction.** Meanwhile, 82% of buyers bought single-family homes while the remaining 18% purchased townhomes or condos. The national median home sale saw an average sales price of $250,000, an average square footage of 1,900 square feet, and &nbsp;three bedrooms and two bathrooms on average.&nbsp;

Various forms of debt, namely student loan debt, credit card debt, and car loan debt, all posed a major obstacle for would-be buyers in 2018.&nbsp;

And, lastly, narrowing our scope to the statewide level, I found it interesting to discover that there is one real estate agent for every 168 people here in Montana.

I hope you found value in today’s message. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
