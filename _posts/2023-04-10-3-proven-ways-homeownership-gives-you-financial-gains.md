What is the true value of owning a home? There are three components to the value of homeownership, and today I’m sharing what they are and how to calculate them:

**1\. Appreciation.** If you hold onto a home, it will appreciate in value. Let's use an example of a $500,000 home and assume a 4% appreciation rate year over year, which is a conservative estimate. During the first year, your $500,000 home is worth $520,000, which means you gain $20,000 in appreciation.

**2\. The value of paying down principal.** To calculate this, use the Place Mortgage Calculator app. You can download it on your iPhone or Android’s app store. Let's assume you purchased a $500,000 home and put down 10%, leaving you with a mortgage amount of $450,000. If you have a 30-year mortgage at today's rate of 6%, your first-year payment will mostly go towards interest. However, you will still reduce your principal by $5,526, and every year, your principal reduction will increase over time. If you decide to sell your house in the first year, you will have gained $20,000 from the home appreciation. Additionally, you will have paid down your mortgage by $5,526, which you will receive half of when you sell the house.

**3\. Tax savings.** You get to write off a portion of the interest that you pay based on your tax rate. You can use the same app to calculate this. Assuming you’re a single person with a 24% tax rate, your tax savings would be $6,444 in year one.&nbsp;

Adding up the three ways you receive value from owning a home, you'll save almost $32,000 in the first year of owning your home. This is a substantial amount of money!
