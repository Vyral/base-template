USDA loans represent a fantastic opportunity for homebuyers. After a recent change, more and more people can qualify for them.

There have been some recent changes to USDA loan programs that we wanted to make sure you knew about today.

**Income limits have gone up for these types of loans.** For a family of four, you can qualify for this loan with an income up to $86,850. The limit is now $114,650 for a family of five or more.&nbsp;

**For households with over eight people, we get to add close to $7,000 per household family member to that annual income calculation.** As more and more families are exploring generational living, this is good news because the USDA loan lets you get into a home with little to no down payment.

This is a great program if you’re eligible. If you have any questions about the program or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
