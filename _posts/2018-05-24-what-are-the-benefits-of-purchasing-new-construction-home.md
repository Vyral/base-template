Are there benefits associated with purchasing a new construction home? It turns out that there are quite a few.

One of the biggest benefits of hiring a builder to construct a new home for you is your **capacity to customize your own home** to meet your needs. Whether it be the number of bedrooms the home has, the layout of the kitchen, the cabinets, the countertops, the flooring, or the paint, you have creative control.

On top of that, new homes are **a lot more energy-efficient** due to higher standards for insulation and your HVAC equipment.

New construction homes also **come with a one-year warranty,** so you get the peace of mind knowing that your new equipment and appliances are covered in case the worst should happen. You can also judge the lifespan of certain features like your roof and heat pump, which come with their own warranties. Codes enforcement officers will be inspecting the property, meaning that your home will be fully up to current building code.

Further still, with new construction, **you know exactly who is working on your home.** With renovations (especially on older homes), it’s hard to be sure whether the people working on your homes are licensed contractors, electricians, etc. New construction homes are inspected and must be approved by licensed professionals, who sign off on a certificate of occupancy saying that the home is fit for habitation.

At the end of the day, when you buy a new construction home you’re buying a home you know is going to be safe and will last you for years.
