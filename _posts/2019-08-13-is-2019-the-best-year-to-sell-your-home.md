**Is 2019 the best year to sell your home?** I was recently asked this question, and since I know there are some would-be sellers out there wondering the same thing, I’d like to share my thoughts today.&nbsp;

Even though predictions of a market shift have come true, interest rates have dropped once again. Homes are indeed staying on the market a little longer, but prices continue to increase and our ratio of homes sold to homes listed is keeping pace with that increase.

**What does all of this mean for you as a seller?**

Well, **if you’re one for gambling, you might want to bet on 2020 being your year**—interest rates could very well drop further. If and when that happens, buyers will that much more purchasing power, which, in turn, raises your home’s value.

**If you’re hesitant to take a gamble and you’d rather extract the value out of your home sooner rather than later, 2019 is your best bet.** Interest rates are amazingly low right now, and with 2020 being an election year, the present poses far more certainty. &nbsp;

The bottom line is if you’re looking to play it safe and you’d like to cash out on your property, there’s no time like the present. If you’re less risk-averse, home prices are trending in the right direction.&nbsp;

No matter the type of seller you are, we look forward to seeing you at the closing table. If you have any questions related to real estate, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at [Dan@MyHomeCarolinas.com](mailto:Dan@MyHomeCarolinas.com) or give me a call at 704-800-6459. Talk to you soon\!
