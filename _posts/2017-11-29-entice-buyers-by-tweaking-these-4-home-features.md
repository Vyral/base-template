Today I’m going to share the top four features that buyers are really searching for in their new dream homes. **If you’re thinking of selling your home, you may want to take special note of this** so that you can see how your home stacks up in regard to what buyers are looking for in the home.

First, did you know that **buyers make up 90% of their mind about whether or not they like your home before they ever get out of the car?** This means that they already know about the price and about the size of the home, but when they pull up and see your home for the first time, they want to know if they can envision themselves pulling up to this home on a daily basis and hanging out outside of it with their families.&nbsp;

Since that’s the case, you need to make sure that the outside is awesome; make sure the pressure washing is done (including the driveway), the landscaping is neatly pruned, and that there is straw or mulch in the plant beds across the board. **Do whatever it takes to make the curb appeal look amazing.**

Second, **is the home family-friendly?** How is the floor plan arranged—do you have an extra, unused bedroom that you could envision being used as a bedroom by another family? Is the backyard neat and clean? The backyard should show as wonderfully as the inside of the home.

Third, does your home need any updates? Are the air conditioner filters clean? Do all your light fixtures work properly? Are there odors present? Essentially, **ask yourself if there’s anything you can do to give the interior a little facelift** to make it look and feel neat and clean. We’d be happy to come over and give you a free evaluation to determine if there’s something that you need to do in order to get it show-ready.

Last but not least, consider your asking price. **Set the price to maximize the return on your investment,** but not at such a range that buyers won’t even come look at the home. We see that when sellers price outside of the acceptable range, they eventually have to lower their price over time, ultimately causing them to end up at the bottom of that range.&nbsp;

Pricing is one of our areas of expertise. We’ll come over and discuss exactly what your home could sell for in today’s market so that you can maximize the value of your home and avoid lowball offers.
