  You have been sending me some great questions and topics to talk about lately,
  and today I would like to address one of those topics: increasing home values.
  Are they overinflated? Home prices are increasing, but year-over-year
  appreciation is reasonable based on historic appreciation levels. To see what
  I am talking about, watch my latest video.

  Based on historic appreciation levels, we should be very comfortable that
  current home values are not overinflated.

Are home values really overinflated?

No. Though, April 2018 marked the 74th straight month of year-over-year gains in median home prices, this does not mean that home values are overinflated again. 

According to Zillow, “If the housing bubble and bust had not happened, and home values had instead appreciated at a steady pace, the median home value would be higher than its current value.”

At the 1:17 mark in the video above, you will see a graph that compares the actual existing median home sales price from 2000 to 2017 with where it would be with normal historic appreciation. As you can see, **based on historic appreciation levels, we should be very comfortable that current home values are not overinflated. **
