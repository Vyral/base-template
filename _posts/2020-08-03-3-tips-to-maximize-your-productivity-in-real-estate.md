I have three tips that will help you maximize your productivity.

How can you maximize your productivity in real estate? I have three great tips:

**1\. Choose your one thing.** There’s a book by Gary Keller called “The One Thing,” and in it he expands on the importance of focus. If you’re in real estate sales, the one thing you likely want to be focusing on is talking to lots of people (better known as ‘prospecting’ or ‘lead follow-up’).

Whether you’re talking to people in your database or cold-calling, that’s part of your one thing. Studies have shown that if you can talk to people about real estate for two to three hours a day, five days a week, that’ll be sufficient fuel to build your real estate business.

**2\. Time block your one thing.** There’s an old saying that goes, “If it’s not in your calendar, it doesn’t exist.” So, if prospecting is your one thing, one of the most critical steps to do is mark it in your calendar and commit to it at that same time five days a week.&nbsp;

**3\. Manage activities around your one thing.** As appointments come into your calendar, or as people ask you to do things, the one commitment you’ll keep around all that is your one thing. When people ask you to do something during that time, you will tell them you’re booked, but ask if another time works.&nbsp;

If you do all three of these things for a full year, I guarantee you’ll build a large real estate business because you’ll have consistency, discipline, and focus.
