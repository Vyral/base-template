What’s the main message you should be communicating to your clients? **There’s currently quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace about what exactly our clients need to hear** and what messaging we should be sending them, whether it’s through marketing channels or when we’re at an appointment presenting to them to see if we’re their agent of choice. There are three messages we can send our clients or communicate to them in person: what we do, how we do it, and why we do it.&nbsp;

I’m flipping this on its head and saying that the “why” is what you need to lead with. Why we do what we do is the main message we need to communicate to our clients. People are inspired by why we do things. They need to learn what we do and how we do it, but they’re emotionally attached to our “why.”&nbsp;

Too often we simply explain what we do and how we do it and miss the boat on the emotional, inspiring connection. **My “why” is to enrich the lives of the people we interact with**\: our team members, the community, and every buyer and seller we serve. I want to leave a legacy for my family, and as I look back on my life, I want to ensure I’ve provided a lasting impact to everyone we’ve come into contact with, whether or not that means I’m the best choice to help them buy or sell a home.

I want to enrich your life. So if you want to learn more about how to start with “why,” how to inspire your clients to buy into what you’re trying to accomplish, and hear about a group of books by Simon Sinek on the topic, just private message me. I’ll send you an array of information about it all.&nbsp;

Feel free to call me at (717) 216-0860 or email [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com) if you have any questions. I would be glad to speak with you.
