It’s going to be held at our office in Hoboken (1 Newark St.) on February 21 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. We’ll have representatives from the real estate, mortgage, and investment worlds. This is going to be an extremely informative event for you, no matter what your home buying goals are. Make sure you register for the event **[here](https://homebuyerseminarfeb212019.eventbrite.com/){: target="_blank"}**, because space is limited.&nbsp;
