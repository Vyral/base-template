Hiring the right Realtor makes a big difference in the success of your home sale or home purchase.

Does it make a difference which Realtor you hire when you decide to buy or sell a house? **Absolutely.**

 First of all, there are more than 37,000 Realtors right here in the Valley ready  to serve you.There are more than 4,200 real estate offices, as well. Last year, 88,000 homes sold in the Valley, and that was done by our own real estate population. If you do the math, that’s only an average of 2.4 transactions per agent.

Think about it—if you were to hire a surgeon to perform an operation on someone you love, would you select one who does a couple operations a year or one who does hundreds?

 In my 31 years as a Realtor, I’ve experienced many different types of transactions. Some of them are easy; some are very challenging. **Between each Realtor, there are also differences in their education level and commitment to the job.** I’ve been a full-time agent for all of my 31 years in the business, and I’ve helped more than 5,000 families buy or sell a house in the Valley.

 When you’re searching for a Realtor, make sure you’re looking for the best in your area. If you have any questions about hiring the right Realtor or you’re considering buying or selling a home, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you.
