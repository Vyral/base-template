The Milford market is extremely hot this fall, and as a home buyer, it’s likely that you’ll find yourself in a multiple offer situation. Here are a few tips to help make your offer stand out to sellers and win you the home you want:

**1. Be simplistic with your offer.** Less is more when it comes to your offer. Focus on the basics, write as strong an offer as you can based on the guidance of your buyer’s agent, and don’t let cosmetic issues concern you. If you’re a first-time home buyer, don’t worry about the cracked tile in the floor or asking for extra contingencies. Make sure your offer is clean, basic, and as aggressive as possible.

**2.Consider writing a personal letter to the seller.** Take the time to either write a personal letter to the seller or, even better, ask your agent to shoot a video message in which you tell the seller how much you love their home and how you plan on continuing their legacy of proud homeownership in the property. A personal video message, which is even more powerful than a personalized letter, is going to have a major impact on the presentation of your offer. Just like a letter, you can’t guarantee that the listing agent will share it with the sellers, but I guarantee you that a listing agent has never received a personalized video from a buyer to the seller.

**3. Have your agent deliver your offer in person.** Obviously, ask your agent if they are comfortable doing this. After your offer has been submitted to the agent and that agent has forwarded the seller your personalized video and your offer terms, ask your agent to spend five minutes with the seller to explain the offer in more detail and make sure they’ve seen your personalized video. This is your chance to let the seller learn more about your family, explain why you’re coming to town, and establish a real connection with you. Again, this is something that no other buyer agent will be doing.

**4. Present a clean pre-approval with your offer.** Make sure your pre-approval is clear about what you can afford, is concise about your loan program, and states that you are approved. Stay away from letters that say “pre-qualified” and make sure it is as strong and as powerful a letter from a lender as possible. Secondly, ask the loan officer to follow up with the listing agent directly. Give your loan officer permission to call the listing agent and divulge as much information about you as they can, especially the information that positions you as a strong client with solid finances.

These tips can make a world of difference when submitting your offer to a seller. If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home in our market, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!
