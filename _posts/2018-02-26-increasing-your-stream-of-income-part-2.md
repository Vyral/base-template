Today we’re continuing our discussion on how to create a steady stream of income in your business.

Not just in this market, but in markets across the country, we have been seeing a tremendous decrease in inventory. This is because pricing is beginning to peak.

The best thing you can do when speaking to clients is to educate them on these kinds of trends. Following statistics may not direct you to the single most advantageous moment for a client to make their move, but it can certainly help you guide them to a great deal.

**Being able to engage with clients this way will likely lead to referral business, which will contribute to your overall income.**When you provide quality information to the people you work with, you become more than just an agent—you become a fiduciary to your client.

After you help a client make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives, why wouldn’t you provide further insight on how to make the most of their resources after the transaction? You can continue to be of value to your clients even after they close.

**When you become a fiduciary resource for your clients, you are fostering the potential for future business with them or people they refer to you.**
