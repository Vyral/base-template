Today, we have an exciting interview to share with you. Our home advisor, Alexis Becker, is sharing with us how her career started in this industry and what it's like to be a part of our team.

Alexis’s journey began after she had her daughter. When she finished her maternity leave, she found out that her family was moving back to Boston. Needing to find something else to do, she thought about wanting to use her strengths and be passionate about her work.

Her husband encouraged her to get her real estate license, and as she took her online classes, she realized that she had a deep passion for helping people. When they bought their first house, she didn’t understand a lot of it and was very stressed. However, when she started taking the classes, things started to make sense, and **she wanted to help others with their home-buying process.&nbsp;**

After finishing her classes, her friend Jenny (who is also another agent on our team) reached out to her and encouraged her to join. When she did, she learned all that she could. She took on her first clients and quickly realized that this job takes a lot of energy and time to do it well. Things started to get overwhelming for her, but then our team reminded her that she has a lot more value to bring to her clients than just time and availability. **We supported her in finding a better balance between having a successful real estate career and prioritizing her family.&nbsp;**

This job has opened up a lot of opportunities for her. She looks forward to exploring what that could mean for her family and wants to continue helping others.
