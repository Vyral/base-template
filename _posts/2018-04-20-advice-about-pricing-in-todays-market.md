Today I want to talk to you a little about pricing properties. As we come into the spring selling season, especially in these limited-inventory markets, it’s a really common mistake for agents and their sellers to pick the wrong price.

They look at the trajectory of the market, at other listings, and at what’s already sold and then try to make a price that’s slightly above that. What’s interesting is that if you look at the stats in almost any market in San Diego County right now, **you’ll find that many home sellers are just sitting on the market while others are selling in mere days.**

Why are some homes selling and others not?

**It comes down to affordability.** Whenever you’re in an extremely limited-inventory market with rising interest rates, buyers are going to be looking for the right value. The most important thing a seller can do today is price aggressively to sell quickly. Ultimately, the market is going to determine the right price for that property.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>Help your sellers pick the price that causes the home to sell. **That price is probably at or even just below the most recent comparable sale.** This will ensure that the home sells quickly and possibly even with multiple offers, which can run the price up.

If you have any questions about how to help your sellers get the most money in this market, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
