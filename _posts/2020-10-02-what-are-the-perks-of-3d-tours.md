<center><em>Here&rsquo;s why we utilize 3D tours for our home sales.</em></center>

<br>Today I'm sharing three huge perks of 3D virtual tours and how they can help you solve the challenges of selling in any market.

**1\. It’s like doing an open house 24 hours a day, seven days a week without even having to leave the house**. It lets buyers take a look at your home at their own pace. For example, we took over a property in NW Calgary that was on the market with another agent for 252 days before COVID and we were able to sell it in under 30 days after the pandemic began.

One of the reasons we were able to sell the home was because of our 24-hour open house. As you can see in the video above, we had over 54,000 Calgary area people come through our virtual open house on Facebook alone. You probably couldn’t do that on a Sunday afternoon open house between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.

**2\. The buyers can determine if your home really is a fit without bothering you**. With a 3D tour, buyers self-select. This pre-screening saves you time and it saves the buyers time, too. That’s a win-win.

**3\. If the property has an occupant we don't always have to bother them and kick them out**. We can show the home anytime with these tours instead. We had one luxury property with tenants that was going to be difficult to get into because of personalities, kids, and COVID. We knew it had the potential to be a tougher project because another agent had previously tried to sell it before COVID and failed after 273 days. We overcame the problems, did videos and 3D tours, and were able to get it sold in 17 days for 99.4% of the asking price all during COVID.

**Bonus perk:** We helped make it safe, convenient, and efficient for the buyers, tenants, and service providers and they were able to get everything they needed without having to physically access the property. They were then able to start work right away after possession without delays.

These are just four of the many perks that come with using a 3D tour to help sell your home. This is one tactic inside of a larger marketing strategy that we follow.
