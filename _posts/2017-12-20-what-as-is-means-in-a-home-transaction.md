{% include youtube.html %}I can’t believe it’s already December. It’s been a crazy year to say the least. I wanted to take the time today to answer a question that I receive during almost every transaction, “What does an 'as-is' home sale mean?”<br><br>Anybody that is buying or thinking about buying a home should know going in that there are going to be defects in the home. Even if it’s a brand new home, they will be there. However, the option period allows you to do your due diligence, giving you a certain amount of time to investigate the property. If you want to back out of the deal for any reason at all—including defects found in the home—buyers are allowed to do that.

{% include pullquote.html %}As a seller, once you sign a contract with a buyer you are locked in. However, you are not required to make any repairs. You can choose to sell the home in its present condition “as-is.” Most of the time, however, this method only works in a strong, strong seller’s market. <br><br>Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, you need to be crystal clear about what your options are before signing a deal and what the timeline is going to look like. When you know your position going in, the process will be a lot easier.<br><br>This will be my last post of the year, so I just wanted to take a moment to wish you all the best this holiday season. I hope your new year starts out great! If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
