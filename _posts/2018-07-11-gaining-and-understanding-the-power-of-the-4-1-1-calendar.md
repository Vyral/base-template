Today's next millionaire mindset tip, I will talk about how to use the 4-1-1 calendar.

For our last millionaire mindset coaching tip, we talked about the GPS plan, also known as the 1-3-5 plan. As you may remember, this is a simple one-page business plan to help you achieve your goals. If you do not have your plan in place, you can rewatch the video <u><strong><a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" target="_blank" href="https://realestatecareersinutah.com/a-one-page-business-plan-to-achieve-your-goals.html">here</a></strong></u>.&nbsp;

Our goal now is to turn your to-do list into a success list. **This simple template for weekly, monthly, and annual planning turns your “one thing” intentions into actions.&nbsp;**

Begin with your annual goal in mind and then drill down into the monthly and weekly milestones you must achieve to hit that goal. I look at monthly goals as my parking lot. This is where I put the strategies for my 4-1-1 that I intend to work on for the month. I then begin the process of unpacking these items from the monthly goals into the weekly goals. The weekly goals are a must-do list, not a task list. Goals, after all, are a dictator of action.

Once the goal is unpacked into weekly must-do items, the next step is to calendar those items to actually get them done. Each weekend, I create my 4-1-1 success list and calendar the most important things I need to get done. When adding must-do’s to your calendar, remember to leave plenty of white space, because real estate is a business that is expandable. You will need time to take care of working in your business as well as working on your business, so it is important not to have a schedule that is overfilled. &nbsp;

I am usually able to finish between three and five must-do’s per week from each of the four categories in the 4-1-1. Do not try to do more than seven.

By the time I show up to the office, I have my must-do calendar set, which helps bulletproof myself from myself. I simply show up and follow what is on my calendar. Like I require of all my coaching clients, **review and update your 4-1-1 on a weekly business and do it away from the office before the week starts to amplify your success.&nbsp;**

The 1-3-5 plan combined with the 4-1-1 calendar and a disciplined approach to that calendar will create the success you deserve.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about today’s topic, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to discuss the 4-1-1 calendar with you further.
