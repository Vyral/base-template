How can you best position your home to generate multiple offers in our hot seller’s market? Over the past year, I have sold around 65 homes, and here are a few tips I use with the home sellers I work with that are proven to attract multiple offers.

First, **take your time getting your home ready for the market.** Don’t be in a rush to list your home—make sure everything about it that needs to be touched up is touched up before photos are taken and before any buyers walk into the house.

Second, **let your neighbors know about your impending home sale.** For every person who hires me to sell their home, I am out door-knocking and calling over 100 people on their behalf. We have found that over 10% of homes sell primarily because of a neighborhood referral.

There are thousands of homes for sale along the Wasatch Front, so **do not assume that all real estate agents will see your home.** Call or email the top 50 real estate agents in your area and notify them that you are putting your home on the market. If you sit back and assume they will see your listing, you will miss out on getting top dollar for it.

Lastly, **do not just accept the first offer.** This is a mistake I see a lot of people making right now. Selling your home is a numbers game. When I hear someone say that they sold their house in under an hour, what that really means is they could have gotten more for it. I market all my sellers’ homes for at least four or five days once they are listed before I start reviewing offers. You want to make sure 100% of the buying pool gets to see your home. That is how you can get as many as three, five, or even 18 offers for your home.

If you have any more questions about how to generate multiple offers for your home sale or you have any other real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be glad to help you.
