The inventory of available homes in Tucson is shrinking, and this is also occurring on a national level. However, what are you to do if you’re trying to buy a home? That’s what we’ll be discussing today.

One simple thing you can do is speak with a mortgage lender and get pre-qualified for a home loan. When you’re crafting offers to sellers, you need to stand out, and being pre-qualified is one way to push your offer to the top of the pile. In fact, most sellers will not even entertain an offer from a buyer who has not been pre-qualified.

Why let someone purchase your home if you are unsure that they can afford it? That’s what sellers are thinking when you submit an offer without a pre-approval or a pre-qualification. This is why you absolutely have to be approved to buy a home.

You will also need to hire a Realtor in order to craft a more attractive offer to a seller. We can also help you find homes that you might not have found otherwise. We work with other Realtors who have pocket homes that are unavailable to most of the public.

We can help you find your dream home - and we can help you purchase it for a fair price. Please don’t hesitate to contact us!
