Do you have to put 20% down in order to purchase a home? How much will rising interest rates affect the market? I get those two questions quite often, and I have some great news!

First, **30-year fixed loans are still at a 4% interest rate,** which is still very attractive.

Second, we have conventional financing with 20% down or more. However, we have a number of programs that require a substantially smaller down payment. **FHA loans are about 3.5% down,** rural development loans are 0% down, VA loans are 0% down, and regular conventional loans can be anywhere from 3% down to 15% down depending on what you qualify for.

There are a number of ways you can get into a home, and if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call. I’m always happy to help!
