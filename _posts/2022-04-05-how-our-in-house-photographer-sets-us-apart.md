Here at HI Pacific Property Management, one of the reasons we can offer an eviction guarantee is because we have an in-house photographer on staff. He takes pictures of each one of our properties prior to new tenants moving in. **The pictures are time stamped and dated, so if we need to go to court, we have all that evidence on file.&nbsp;**

Having a professional photographer on staff also ensures our photos are uniform; plus, if we need someone to take photos on short notice, it’s not a problem. On top of all this, he creates virtual tours for our properties.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our photographer or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
