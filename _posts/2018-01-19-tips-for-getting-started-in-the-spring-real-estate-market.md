If you want to make a move this spring, when should you get started? What is your first step?

My advice is to start with the end in mind. If you want to miss the spring competition for homes, you should start Super Bowl weekend or earlier.

Your first step is to talk to two or three lenders to determine if you will qualify for a loan and which loan program you should use. The lender will also help you figure out what your monthly budget says the price of your home should be.

Next, determine which areas or subdivisions fit all of your criteria. Then, start shopping for homes that are for sale but not yet officially on the market.

You will need a Realtor who is a consultant, not a salesperson, to guide you through these steps with realistic options.
