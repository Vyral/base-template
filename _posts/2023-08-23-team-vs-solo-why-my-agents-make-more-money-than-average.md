A misconception I hear all the time is that it’s easier to make money in real estate by yourself than with a good team.&nbsp;

**Here's the deal:** In a traditional brokerage setting, you put in all the work just like you would by yourself, but then your brokerage takes a cut of your earnings. That's not the case on my team. We take a huge chunk of your work off your plate and do it for you, so you can focus on money-making activities and do more transactions.&nbsp;

We take care of upfront paperwork, marketing, backend paperwork, transactions, and follow-up with your clients. **All you have to do is focus on selling homes.** That’s why agents on my team tend to sell so much more than your average agent.&nbsp;

If you’d like to learn more about what we do for you and how it can help you make more money, call us at [(515) 346-6204](tel:515-346-6204) or email [Misty@MistySOLD.com](mailto:Misty@MistySOLD.com). I look forward to hearing from you!
