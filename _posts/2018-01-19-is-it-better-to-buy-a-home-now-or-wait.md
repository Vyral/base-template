Are you better off waiting to buy a home or buying now?

Every market is different, just like everyone’s financial situation is different.

Two things we can’t control are the rise and fall of home prices and the rise and fall of interest rates. That’s why **the best time to buy a house is whenever is best for you and your family and your financial situation**.

Waiting to buy may cost you, but it’s more important that you buy when the time is right for you. I know I’m not worried about the cost of waiting.
