Today, I’m here to discuss LEED certification and how it can impact your organization.

“Green building practices” is one of the most popular buzzwords in today’s market, and with good reason. Did you know that it’s estimated that over $200 billion is going to be spent on green projects in 2018? With that comes an increase in employment.

In 2014, there were two million roles that were specific to green building projects. In 2018, it’s estimated that will increase by 1.1 million, **resulting in about 3.3 million roles in the green building industry. That equates to about $76 billion in wages.**

Companies are looking at how they can stay competitive. One of the areas that we’re finding to be the most significant in terms of success is that **they’re offering to pay for LEED certification**opportunities with their current employees.

In turn, it’s showing the employee that** the company is loyal to their future education.** It’s also helping the company by having the opportunity to win these projects or be involved in them from a product perspective.
