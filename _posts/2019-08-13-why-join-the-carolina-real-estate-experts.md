<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Joining our team might be the best career move you’ll ever make. Here’s why.</em></p>

Attention, all agents\!&nbsp;

Are you on pace to hit your goal of selling 30, 40, or 50 units by the end of the year? If you’re not, I have a message for you today.&nbsp;

Here at Carolina Real Estate Experts, our agents sell at least 30 homes per year. Thanks to our systems, accountability, tracking, and the fact that we have hot leads calling us to do business, all of our agents can hit their mark year in and year out.&nbsp;

Why am I telling you this? Well, we’re looking to add new members to further strengthen our team\!

This opportunity isn’t for everyone: **We’re looking for individuals who are hungry for more growth in their career, desire meaningful coaching and accountability, and want to provide a life they never thought possible for themselves and their family. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;**

I’m asked time and time again, “Dan, does your team charge desk fees?” And the answer is no\! We’re not some large firm whose sole focus is bringing in hundreds upon hundreds, if not thousands, of agents into their offices to collect desk fees. On the contrary, **our focus and drive is to see our agents succeed and provide them world-class coaching, and we’d like to do the same for you.** &nbsp;

If this opportunity excites you and you’re ready to take your career to the next level, please reach out to us for a confidential, no-obligation conversation about what we do as a team that makes us a cut above the rest in this area. Let’s build your career together. We look forward to hearing from you soon\!&nbsp;
