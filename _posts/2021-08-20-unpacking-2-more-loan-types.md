I’m back with Abel Tejeda for part three of our financing series. In previous videos, we discussed the VA loan; today we’ll cover FHA and conventional loans.

The FHA is probably the most lenient loan type available. You can qualify for one with a credit score of 580, though a 620 or higher is preferred. That’s why most people refer to it as a first-time homebuyer program. It’s a government loan designed to help people with lower income since **it allows those with a higher debt-to-income ratio to buy a house.** With an FHA loan, you need to put down at least 3.5%, which translates to $3,500 per every $100,000 on the price of the property.

If you have no debt at all, the minimum income requirement for the FHA loan is $6,000 a month. If you have debt, the minimum income requirement will increase. Having a co-borrower will help in situations where your debt is higher than you’d like it to be.&nbsp;

As far as debt goes, lenders look at your minimum payment rather than the balance. So for example, if you have a $10,000 loan and your minimum payment is only $50, they’ll consider the $50. Don’t disqualify yourself just because you have a lot of debt.

**The conventional loan is a little more difficult to qualify for because it is credit-driven.** A conventional loan will get you a better rate given your credit score, but it is much stricter when it comes to your debt-to-income ratio. With an FHA loan, you can go up to 56% (meaning that no more than 56% of your income can go towards debt), but the limit with a conventional loan is 50%. For down payments, borrowers can go as far down as 3%, depending on the area and the property. With a conventional loan, you can get away with unpermitted additions, whereas with the FHA, you’ll be forced to get the permits or take down the additions.&nbsp;

The FHA loan is a great way to go, but understand that lenders are becoming a bit more lenient with conventional loans. If you have a credit score of 680 or higher, you might as well go the conventional route. You’ll only need 5% down, and you can avoid mortgage insurance.

If you have any additional questions about these types of loans or which is best given your circumstances, give us a call.
