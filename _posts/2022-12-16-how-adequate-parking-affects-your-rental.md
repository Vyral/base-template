Today I'm here to talk about something very important: adequate parking. **In Hawaii, parking is the number one issue when buying a home.** The first thing I ask homeowners is if they have any parking on their property. I need to know if it’s assigned, and how many spots there are. This will greatly affect the rent price.&nbsp;

A lot of people have a four-bedroom house with one parking spot. They justify that because they say there's plenty of street parking, but that doesn’t count as assigned parking. **If you have a home or a rental property that doesn’t have any assigned parking spots, we will not manage it.** It's just too difficult for our property managers to get in and out, for the tenant to come and see the place, for visitors and service vehicles to park, etc.&nbsp;

In Hawaii, having adequate parking is extremely important in the rental business. I have property outside of Hawaii, and I have noticed that it's not as important in other places. However, **here, parking is key.**&nbsp;

If you have any questions about adequate parking, call me at (808) 445-9223 or visit my website <u><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hipacificpm.com/">here</a></strong></u>. I hope to talk to you soon\!&nbsp;
