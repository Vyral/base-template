As you can see in the video above, I’m obviously not in Louisville or Southern Indiana right now. You might recognize the famous Colosseum in Rome as today’s backdrop. However, that doesn’t mean I’m not still plugged into the latest numbers for our real estate market. I’m going over them in detail to show what they mean for you then I'll take you along with me on a tour of this historic structure.
