Today we are going to highlight a few of the many reasons you should consider owning a home instead of continuing to rent:

**1. Mortgage interest rates.** They are still historically low, and often fixed. This means at the end of the year, your payment will remain the same. When you rent and go to renew your lease at the end of the year, it may rise.

**2. Tax benefits.** At the end of the year, you get to deduct your property taxes and your mortgage interest. If you were to subtract that out of your mortgage payment, it is probably going to be cheaper than your rent payment.

**3. Forced savings.** Every month, you are making a payment toward your principal balance, which is resulting in equity being built. Even if home values do not rise (even though historical data says they are due), you are automatically going to get savings. When home values do rise, you get to take advantage of that equity as well.

**4. Personalize your home.** Oftentimes when you rent, the landlord has strict requirements and makes you leave the condition in the home that is given to you. You cannot change the paint, flooring, light fixtures, or anything else that personalizes your home. You do not have to worry about any of this when you own a home.
