I’m here today to talk to you about some of my favorite places in the area that you may not know about. We're visiting two of them today, and I’m excited to talk about them.

**First up is [Lulu’s](http://www.lulubuffett.com/destin/), a restaurant in Destin right by the Mid-Bay Bridge.** They have a big outdoor beach, lots of great seating, and all kinds of activities and events for kids. It has beautiful views of the ocean with both outdoor and indoor seating.

Next, we’re headed to **[Pedego Bikes](https://www.pedegoelectricbikes.com/dealers/santa-rosa-beach/)**, one of my favorite spots. They rent and sell electric bikes here, and I actually bought one for Christmas. It’s been a ton of fun for me and my family. It lets us explore 30A without having to pedal up any steep hills.

We were delighted to be joined by Pedego Bikes owner Jason Medina. He recently retired from the Coast Guard after 22 years and created this store in part to get through some of the congestion and parking issues he faced. **Jason says electric bikes are the best way to get around 30A, and I agree.** They offer sales and rentals to get the whole family out there cruising around.

They are located at 174 Watercolor Way in Santa Rosa, right next door to Publix and the UPS Store. I encourage you to come check out some of these bikes and take one for a test drive yourself.

If you have any questions for me about either of these places or about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
