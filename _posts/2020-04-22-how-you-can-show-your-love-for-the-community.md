<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’re always looking for ways to lend a helping hand. If you’ve also been aching to help those in need, here are some simple ways to get started.</em></p>

Whether it be through financial donations or volunteering your time, there are so many ways to give back to the community right now.&nbsp;

The first step is to identify what cause is dearest to your heart. **Look at your neighborhood; what needs are there to be filled?** Also, truly assess your talents and abilities. What is the best way for you to help in these troubling times? We each have different strengths to offer our neighbors and local organizations. Do what you can, and do what makes the most sense for you.&nbsp;

Is it a large one-time donation of canned goods? Is it a regular donation of money to a charity? Is it committing your time to help one person in need? **That’s the beauty of doing good—there are endless ways for you to lift others up**, it just takes some planning and a little gusto to get started.&nbsp;

We wanted to give you a small sampling of the countless opportunities there are to help. Below is a list of local San Fernando Valley organizations working to help victims of the virus as well as those facing turmoil amid our economic halt. From helping out healthcare workers to supporting local restaurants that are suffering, this list runs the gamut; everyone is sure to find a cause that resonates with them.&nbsp;

I hope you’re able to give back to those in need. If you find yourself in the category of those who need our community’s support, please reach out to us or any of the amazing organizations listed. We want to do everything we can to lend a hand.&nbsp;
