The agent referral fee is an important tool for both buyer and seller agents. **Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, though, we do not do sales—we only do property management.** You can consider us experts on this topic.

For example, if you want advice on how much a unit can rent for, or want to know whether one unit is better to buy than another, I would certainly love to consult with your clients about those types of things. There’s no charge for any information we give out. Just give us a call or look me up in the ‘agent’ section of the MLS.

We give the first month’s property management fee to the referring agent, and if your owner decides to sell one day, we offer a 100% client-return-to-agent guarantee in our referral agreement. I’d be happy to talk to your clients about the possibility of renting out their properties. Oftentimes, I have to educate sellers on HARPTA law or 1031 exchanges, so don’t hesitate to use us as a reference to obtain information.

As always, if you have questions about this or any topic related to property management, call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.
