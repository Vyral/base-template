How can you have a loan amount that’s higher than the FHA limit in Lake County? Can a seller hold a small note for an FHA, like a second mortgage? Today we’ll answer both of these questions.

In the final installment of our series where we answer agents' questions, today we’re fielding a two-parter from Allison Wheatley of First Realty.

First, she asks, “Someone said that the FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850; however, one of my buyers has a loan amount of $285,000. How does that work?”

Secondly, she asks, “Can the seller hold a small note for an FHA, like a second mortgage?”

To answer her first question, the FHA does set loan limits per county, and they’ll change based on what county you live in. **The FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850, but that’s not the purchase price limit.** People can purchase homes for however much they want, but the FHA has stated that they will not lend any more than the $274,850 limit in that county.

For example, if somebody wants to buy a house that costs $300,000, that’s perfectly OK; however, they’re going to have to put down the extra $25,150 to bring the base loan amount down to the FHA loan limit in our county.

To answer her second question, **the FHA doesn’t allow interested party contributions such as seller-held second mortgages into the transaction.** The only thing the sellers can do, per FHA guidelines, is help pay up to 6% in closing costs into the transaction.

If you or your buyers have any other questions in regard to FHA loans or their requirements, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d be happy to help!
