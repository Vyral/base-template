&nbsp;I've collected the top three projects that stand out in terms of the return they will give on your investment.

**1. Fiberglass attic insulation.** Each year, Remodeling magazine releases its Cost vs. Value Report for various home upgrades. This year, **only one project had an ROI of over 100% and that was fiberglass attic insulation.** If you add insulation to your attic tomorrow and decide to sell your home right after, you can expect that you will be able to sell for a premium. Even if you aren't selling your home just yet, then the improved attic insulation will accrue even more value as the years go on, in terms of lower heating bills and increased comfort in your home.

**2. Energy-efficient windows.** A typical window replacement yields over a 70% return in terms of the resale value of your home. Depending on the shape of your current windows, **you could save an additional 15% or more off your heating bills.** Plus, new windows can add even more value to your home in terms of increased thermal and acoustic comfort, more light, and better design.&nbsp;

**3. Have an energy audit.** For only $99, SRP and APS partner with many local companies that will come out and check your windows, ductwork, A/C unit, and give you a full report of anything to be addressed to increase the efficiency of your home. Then from there you can choose what will be the best investment for your home.
