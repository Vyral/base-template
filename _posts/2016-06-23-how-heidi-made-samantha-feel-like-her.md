“I’m actually from New York and California was very unfamiliar to me and when I first came here I was actually referred to Heidi Phong Real Estate Team, one of the things, as soon as I came into her office and I saw her bright smile, welcoming, I felt very fortunate because she’s this young but successful career woman but she’s also got this great personality, very similar to mine actually. The way she presented her company, the values she talked to me about her company, for me customer service is very important and I really felt that she felt, she made me feel [like I was] priority. She knew what I wanted. I told her what my criteria were, she tried to meet every part of it. Throughout the entire time she and her team, they were very patient with me. I’m somebody who, I want to buy a house, I want to go see this house. They really, really accommodated me around my schedule, even at night time I would still text Heidi and say Heidi what’s the status of this property? And she’s very good at it, she’s always updating me. She’s on top of her game. Very, very respectful and always fighting on behalf of me as her buyer. So I really respect that from her. The good thing is I saw a house I wanted, it was like a dream house to me, she closed in 15 days. She even got me a discount, she got me lower than the listing price, so I’m very, very happy. “
