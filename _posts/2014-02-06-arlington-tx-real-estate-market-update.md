I am always asked about the current state of the market; so today we will talk about what 2014 real estate in North Texas will look like.

One of the important things to consider when looking ahead to 2014 is to understand what happened at the end of 2013 for our local area. December 2013 showed a 20% increase in the volume of sales in comparison to December 2012. It actually was the highest sales volume in our recorded history! As a matter of fact, each of the last 10 months of 2013 was the biggest month of North Texas realty. Rolling in 2014, that is exactly what we’re looking at.

Most price points show the evidence of a seller’s market. The reasoning behind this is the lower number of foreclosures coming onto the market. Since more people are relocating into North Texas more than any other major metropolitan area in the nation, new home builders are cranking back into full swing. With interest rates still staying low, our outlook for 2014 is very strong. Due to the Fed tapering back their stimulus package, interest rates may be on the rise.

However, there is no one answer for everybody. Here at the Chad Smith Team, we focus on taking all of this information and listening to what’s most important for our clients. From there, we let them know what is most important; it may or may not be the right time to make a move in the market and we understand that.

If you or anyone you know is weighing the option of making a move this year, we would love to sit down with you analyze your situation so you can make a sound business decision. Thanks and have a great day!
