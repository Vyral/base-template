&nbsp;I recently listed a beautiful home for sale at 1588 Laurel Circle in Vista. I went on “List It Live” to talk about why I’m so excited about it.

I was recently a guest on “List It Live” and I had the opportunity to showcase one of my gorgeous new homes that has recently come on the market.&nbsp;

1588 Laurel Circle in Vista is in a gated community, has wonderful curb appeal, and is on the market right now for $599,000.

Not only is the home affordable, but so are the HOA dues of $277 per month. Those dues include a beautiful community pool and a community center with meeting rooms, a rec room, spa, jacuzzi, and more.

The backyard of 1588 Laurel Circle has a gorgeous, private patio that is perfect for outdoor entertaining and the open floor concept really maximizes the space in the home. Did I mention that it’s move-in ready?

To get a better look at this home for yourself, visit www.1588laurelcircle.com. All of the information you need is there.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
