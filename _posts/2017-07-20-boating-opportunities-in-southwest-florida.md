We’ve got some of the best places for boating and fishing here in southwest Florida. We’ll go through the whole coast from Charlotte Harbor to Tampa Bay.

In Charlotte Harbor, you’re going to have saltwater canals and harbor fronts giving you access into the harbor. You’ll see properties going for $250,000 and it will more than likely be an older and smaller home, but **it’s a great place to start your boating adventures**.

Englewood is another great place, as it sits right on the Gulf of Mexico and features saltwater canals. This area is better if you own smaller boats, and for $450,000 you’ll be able to get a home with quick boating access to Gulf.

Coming up the coast to Venice, Nokomis, and Osprey, you’ll see similar opportunities as Englewood. The difference is you’ll see prices start to rise from $450,000 and up if you want to get into good water.

Heading further north, we have Sarasota which is a very metropolitan area with a lot of amenities. **Housing prices overall are considerably more expensive than the communities to the south**. Boating opportunities in Sarasota are going to start around $550,000 but the best properties are going for $1.2 million and up. We have a lot of great waterfront condos in this area as well.

**I think that the best water is in the Bradenton area**. Many people will try to dismiss it, but it’s surrounded on two sides by big water: the Gulf of Mexico to the west, and Tampa Bay to the north. On the west side of Bradenton, $450,000 will get you a pretty nice waterfront property, and on the eastern side there are some fabulous waterfront communities.

Finally, another option are the barrier islands that litter the coast. Most of the condos on these islands have deeded boat slips so if you’re looking for a condo that may be the place to look.

If you have any questions about any of these areas or you’re looking to buy or sell a house in southwest Florida, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!
