Today I wanted to discuss some of the more popular neighborhoods in Mansfield. Now is a great time to buy, so these are some of the neighborhoods that you might want to investigate:

* The Trails
* Walnut Creek Country Club
* Dover Heights

A majority of the new building is occurring in the Lake Ridge High School District, but there are some other wonderful new communities forming in Garden Heights, Bower Ranch, Las Brisas, and the D.R. Horton neighborhood. I think a majority of the growth in Mansfield will be happening in the southeast corner for the near future.

In the future, I expect growth will happen more out to the west of town. The city is really beginning to manage development out in those areas.

Overall, Mansfield is becoming a hot spot to live, so if you plan on buying in the near future, please don't hesitate to contact me and I can help you to find a great place to settle into.

I look forward to speaking with you!
