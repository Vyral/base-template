Today we've got four mega tips for you as a first-time home seller. These four tips will help you prepare your home for success on the market.

**1. Price your home accurately:** Hire an agent to perform a comprehensive market analysis, which compares your home to nearby homes and what they sold for. They will come up with a value based on a number of factors like size and location. We might check our logic against Zillow, but it shouldnâ€™t be trusted as your only source.

<br>**2. Prepare your home for sale:**Consider taking half of your furniture out of the house because you want buyers to come through and wonder if anybody lives there. You want to give them an idea of what the house looks like without being overwhelmed with clutter and furniture, which can make rooms look small. A fresh coat of paint can add a lot of value as well.

**3. Be flexible with showings:** It can be overwhelming, so I always recommend to consider leaving home for the first weekend your house goes on the market to let it be completely available for showings or an open house. When you're in town and there's a showing scheduled, you want to be out of the house during that showing so buyers can have open conversations amongst themselves.

**4. Use professional photography:** iPhones take good pictures but I wouldn't use it to market a home. Professional photographers have a keen eye for angles that display your home well and showcase color to make photos pop. On our team, we incorporate video and drone photography as well.
