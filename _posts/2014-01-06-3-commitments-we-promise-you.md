Whether you're buying your first or your fifth home, the loan process can always be stressful. At [Movement Mortgage](http://www.movementmortgage.com/) we understand that. We treat each situation as our top priority. We do this with three commitments.

1. Lots of detailed communication through regularly scheduled updates.
2. To close accurately, you will know every penny you spend.
3. Close on time, every time.

We only work with the industry's best. Janet Gresh is one of the top agents. Together with these three commitments we promise your mortgage process will be smooth and stress free.

If you have any questions, please give me a call today at 703.463.8250.
