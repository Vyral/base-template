How can you provide for yourself while giving so much to others? For busy agents like us, this industry is relentless. If you don’t take care of your mental well-being, the stress of your career could leak into your personal life. In my experience, the best things we can do for ourselves are the exact same things we do to grow our businesses. Let me explain.&nbsp;

One of the best things you can do in this business is tracking. Tracking gives us clarity on how much farther we need to go to meet our goals.&nbsp;

**My team uses a tool called a personal wellness assessment that allows you to track the areas of your life you want to focus on.** These include categories like emotions, spirituality, marriages, families, personal finances, recreation, fitness, and just about every other aspect of your life.&nbsp;

If you’d like to use this tool to organize your life, just send me a private message below, call (717) 216-0860, or email [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com). I’ll send you the template and even jump on a private strategy call with you. I look forward to hearing from you\!
