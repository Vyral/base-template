We are very insistent that our clients have a solid follow-up nurture campaign for the leads we give to them. It is one of the ingredients for getting the best ROI by hiring us. **Today I want to share four pieces to that campaign that are essential:**

**1. Automation.** It is great to have a CRM, but you need to have automation, too. It does not have to be anything terribly sophisticated, but you need to have some email sequences that automatically go out to your nurture clients.

**2. Multiple contact points.** There needs to be variety in the way you reach out in the form of emails, text messages, phone calls, and more. Direct mail may be a little more expensive, but it is great to consider doing at least a few times per year.

**3. Add value.** You need to give prospects something that tells them you are the authority they should work with. You do not want to be nagging them, but you want to give them content that educates and nurtures them. No matter the avenue you choose, make sure youâ€™re giving them your best stuff.

**4. A CRM that triggers tasks.** Automation is fantastic and super important, but your sales team should be following up with prospects via phone call and text message as well.

These things sound simple enough, but I talk with successful team leaders who do not have these things in place. If they did, they would be even more successful. A great nurture is going to drastically increase your ROI from working with us.

If you have any questions for us or want to sign up for a free consultation to see if we could be a fit together, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
