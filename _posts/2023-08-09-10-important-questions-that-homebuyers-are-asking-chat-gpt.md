Are you on the hunt for your dream home? Never fear,&nbsp;[Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;is here! :)

I understand that the process can be overwhelming, which is why we (naturally) asked Chat GPT which questions Homebuyers most often ask about the process. Over the next several weeks we'll answer ALL of them on our&nbsp;[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/larkingroup/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and&nbsp;[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoStGeorgeTV){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;pages.&nbsp;

Check out the top 10 questions&nbsp;[HERE](https://stgeorgerealestatevideos.com/10-important-questions-that-homebuyers-are-asking-chat-gpt.html){: target="_blank"}!&nbsp;

Here are the top 10 most common questions that homebuyers asked Chat GPT:

1\. What is the asking price of the property?

2\. How many bedrooms and bathrooms does the house have?

3\. What are the property taxes for this home?

4\. Is the neighborhood safe and family-friendly?

5\. What is the condition of the roof, HVAC system, and other components?

6\. Are there any known issues or repairs needed in the house?&nbsp;

7\. What appliances and fixtures are included in the sale?&nbsp;

8\. How long has the property been on the market?&nbsp;

9\. What are the nearby amenities such as schools, parks, and shopping centers?&nbsp;

10\. Has a property had any previous offers or inspections?&nbsp;&nbsp;

These questions are a fantastic starting point when considering a new property, but they might not cover every aspect that’s important to you. If you have specific inquiries that don’t fall within these categories or if you’d like a human’s opinion on any of these matters, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone call or email.
