When a buyer drives past your home, the first thing they’ll see is your front door. This means you want it to make a good first impression, and the best place to start is with the door’s color. **Let’s go over the three primary options you have when choosing the color of the door:**

* **Traditional.** Black is a basic but striking choice for your door’s color. If you have white trim, it creates a beautiful contrast.
* **Bold.** Think color—oranges, yellows, and reds. This will make it pop immediately to anyone who drives by. Bold colors are especially popular in coastal regions.
* **Somewhat subdued.** This usually means simply matching the trim of your home. You’ll end up being somewhere between a high-contrast black and a bold, eye-popping color.
