Today I’m excited to be joined by special guest Carey Baker. I had the opportunity to ask Carey some questions about her involvement with The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. Her and her husband, Brett Baker, are Co-chairs for Toyland Ball 2018.

**The Toyland Ball, held every January, is The Parent Child Center of Tulsa’s annual signature fundraising event.** This black tie gala featuring a whimsical theme offers an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, with a live auction.

I caught up with Carey at the Toyland Ball Stock the Bar Party where attendees bring a bottle of wine valued at $50 or more to be auctioned off at the Toyland Ball 2018 in January. In past years, the wine auctioned off at the event in January has raised between $8,000 and $10,000 for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. That is just the money raised from auctioning the wine. There are other items that are auctioned off that raise even more money for the cause.

For those of you who may not know, the mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy. People who have been **victims of abuse or neglect are given education and counseling so that they are able to end the cycle.** Many people only know what they’ve been taught, so The Parent Child Center of Tulsa aims to reverse this.

If you’re interested in attending, **the Toyland Ball auction will take place on January 20th, 2018 at the Cox Business Center. For tickets, visit www.ParentChildCenter.org.** You can also become a patron sponsor by donating $1,000 for two people.

At the event, there will be raffles, an auction, and a live band. Also, all of the proceeds go directly to the counseling funds for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa.

**We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
