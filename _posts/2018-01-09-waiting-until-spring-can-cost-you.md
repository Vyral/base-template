In our opinion, waiting until spring to buy or sell a home is not the best decision. Our Director of Operations, Teri Bowermaster, is here with me today to explain why.

<br>**If you’re a prospective home seller and are waiting for the spring market to list, all you’re doing is opening yourself up to a whole lot more competition.** Everyone else who is thinking about selling their home in your town and in your neighborhood is waiting until spring. Listing now is smart because there are a handful of serious buyers out there and their selection is limited.

<br>At the same time, the spring market starts a race of buyers to new listings. **This is the type of market where we have competing offers and buyers end up paying more than list price.** If you get in the market now, you won’t have to put yourself up against the wall and compete against multiple offers. There’s still a decent selection out there that you can take advantage of. Less competition is a great reason to start your home search.

<br>If you have any questions for us about this market or about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
