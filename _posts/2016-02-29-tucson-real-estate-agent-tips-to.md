About 92% of showings begin on a computer screen. Buyers utilize the Internet to look for their dream home, and they’re likely to stumble upon your MLS listing before your physical address. It could even be on a smartphone. That’s why images are extremely important. They reveal your property, and you want to make sure they’re dazzling. We hire professional photographers to provide quality photos to accompany your listing.

Be sure to increase curb appeal. The first impression is everything for prospective buyers. If buyers don’t like your home from the outside, it’ll deter them from going inside. Clean up the front yard, front door, and the sidewalks. Bring in some bright colors and plant some fresh flowers in the garden.

The inside of your home matters, too. We bring in professional stagers to help our clients make their home shine. We focus on interior design, such as how furniture is arranged and repurposed. When you hire us, you’ll meet with our Interior Decorator; in fact, this consultation is included in our real estate seller program.

Ultimately, we want to do everything in our power to reach out to those 92% of buyers that will see your home for the first time online. That’s our strategy to get as many people through your front door as possible. If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, reach out to us today. We’d be happy to hear from you and serve your local real estate needs!
