We are very fortunate to have great families, good jobs, and warm homes to go to during the Holidays. Unfortunately, this isn't a reality for everyone in our area.

That's why we always help the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. Every year, they provide over 1,000 turkeys to families in need. This is our sixth year in a row, and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon!

We need your help! If you'd like to donate your time or some turkeys, please get in touch with us.

As always, refer to us as your #1 resource for real estate in the LA area!
