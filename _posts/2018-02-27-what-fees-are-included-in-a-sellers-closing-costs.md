  During a real estate transaction, buyers and sellers will both pay closing
  costs, though what fees are included in each party’s net costs will differ.
  Today, we’re breaking down what kinds of fees a seller might be expected to
  pay when they get to the closing table. The first type of fees they’ll be
  responsible for are governmental costs, including conservation fees; recording
  fees to file the deed and other proper documents with the county; and also the
  state deed tax. To learn what other kinds of fees a seller will pay and why,
  watch my latest video.

Today, we’re going to over the standard closing cost that a seller can expect to pay when selling their home. We’re going to going through a quick, estimate seller’s net sheet that we present to all of our sellers and for anybody who requests a market analysis from us, breaking it down into different categories.

**1. Governmental costs.** There will be a conservation fee, which our title companies like to call “feeding the ducks.” There are also recording fees, which are dependent on how many mortgages you have and anything that needs to be recorded. Additionally, there is the state deed tax, which is $3.30 per $1,000 of sales price.

**2. Title costs.** These are fixed fees that the title company will charge you to close the file, run the payoffs, do searches, etc. Included in this fee might be a courier fee, if your lender requires a payment to be overnighted.

**3. Broker fees.** These are broken up with commissions and broker admin fees

**4. Miscellaneous costs.**These may pertain to acreage properties if they’re using a private well or septic system, which may require inspections. Home warranty fees are also typically paid for by the seller. If you live in an HOA, the seller will have to order what’s called a resale disclosure package, which is sent to the buyer. Additionally, a buyer may sometimes ask the seller to contribute to the buyer’s closing costs; this is a negotiable item which we counsel our sellers through, depending on the type of buyer and the type of loan they’re taking out.

**5. Fee proration.&nbsp;**Association fees and property taxes are prorated.

Above and beyond the commission rate that is negotiated, you can expect to pay about a half of a percent, with three quarters of of percent of the sales price in standard, fixed closing costs.
