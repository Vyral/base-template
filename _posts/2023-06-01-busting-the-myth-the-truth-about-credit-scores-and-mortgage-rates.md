Today, Iâ€™m here to address a misconception going around currently. The Biden Administration announced that lower credit scores are going to have lower rates on mortgages. However, this is completely false, and the media is sharing incorrect data.&nbsp;

**Do not stop paying your bills and hope that a lower credit score is going to get you a better rate.** It is still responsible and normal to pay your bills. A good credit score will help you get a better outcome for your mortgage situation.&nbsp;

If you are thinking about buying a home in today's market, please call or email me. I'm happy to get you scheduled for a free consultation.
