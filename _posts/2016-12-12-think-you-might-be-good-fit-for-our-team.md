Our team is hiring, and we’d love for the right person to join us.

 Why work for us? Let me tell you a little bit about what we do and what we can provide for you. We like to divide our business into three categories: before, during, and after.

 Our “before” category is the time in which we generate leads and contacts before we get into contract, whether it’s a buyer or seller agreement. We do our lead generation through Google pay-per-click, Facebook, Zillow, Trulia, mail-out campaigns, and postcarding. On our team, you would no longer have to create these items—we’d create them for you.

 The “during” category is the time in which we’re in contract with a client. We have a management process for this, as well. We would provide a transaction coordinator for you, along with all the information you want or need for educating your clients.

 Finally, the “after” category is the period after escrow closes where we provide all the information and gifts for your buyers or sellers so you can stay in communication with them. We will also supply the CRM contact management system. With RE/MAX, you’d not only get the four webistes that they provide, but you’d also have access to our two lead generation sites: www.greaterrosevillehomes.com and www.besthomesandestates.com. You would have access to these sites and be able to send them out to your clients and contacts.

 Our mission is to build great relationships with the people that you already know or the people that you want to get in contact with.

 What’s the rub? I’m going to be completely honest with you—I don’t want every agent or salesperson to call me. I’m not looking for a salesperson. I’m looking for a consultant. I want someone who’s more interested in helping people and bringing value to those they become associated with. That’s what we built our business on, and that’s the path we want to continue to follow.

We’re looking forward to doing more than 200 deals next year and growing our team to be able to help 200 different families. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, we’d love to talk. To contact us, you can either click on the ‘contact’ button, reply to this email, or just give us a call. I look forward to talking with you soon!
