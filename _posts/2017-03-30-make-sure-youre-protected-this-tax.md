It’s tax season! To make sure your refund dream doesn’t turn into a tax fraud nightmare, Peter Wease, our preferred lender from Fairway Independent Mortgage, has three tips for you.

First, file your taxes early. File your taxes before anyone has a chance to steal your information to file for you and collect your refund.

Second, get a free copy of your credit report. Go online to TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax and they will send you a free copy of your credit report. If you see anything odd going on, make sure you report it immediately.

Finally, get a security freeze put on your credit account. This way, whenever something unusual happens with your credit, the account will freeze until you can review the information and unfreeze it.

If you have any further questions for Peter about protecting yourself this tax season, you can reach him at petew@fairwaymc.com or 503-765-1173.

As always, if you have any questions for me, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
