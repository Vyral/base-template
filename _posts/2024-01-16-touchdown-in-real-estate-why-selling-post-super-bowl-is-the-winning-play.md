Today, let's discuss the upcoming Super Bowl. I'm passionate about sports, I’m married to someone with a long tenure at Nike, and both my kids work in sports-related jobs. The Super Bowl, scheduled for the first Sunday in February, holds significance for NFL fans. However, as a Realtor, my "Super Bowl" starts right after the game ends.

The typical notion is to wait for the spring market, often targeting March or April for house sales, coinciding with spring break in Oregon. Yet, I want to highlight the advantage of starting the process immediately after the Super Bowl, in early February, marking the beginning of our early spring market in the Portland area.

**Listing your house in February provides a strategic edge, as it precedes the influx of listings from February through Memorial Day.** Seizing this early opportunity means facing less competition and avoiding potential price influences from neighboring sellers.

To formulate a game plan for a February listing, it's essential to consult with professionals like me, now. Despite the common perception that February is still deep in winter, it's an opportune time to contemplate and act on your spring plans.

If you’re ready to take action, call or email me. I'm here to address all your real estate inquiries, regardless of size.
