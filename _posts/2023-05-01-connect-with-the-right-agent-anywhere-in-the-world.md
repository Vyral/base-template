Today I want to talk about a pet peeve of mine. It’s when people tell me they aren’t having a great experience with the agent they’re working with within another state and wished I lived there. This pet peeve isn’t your fault by any means; it’s my fault because I haven’t educated people properly.

**The truth is that I can help you anywhere.** I may be licensed in Oregon and can service all of Oregon, but the reality is, after 20 years of doing this, I know the real estate arena in every state. I've been with my brokerage for many years, and I've tapped into a network of amazing agents.&nbsp;

If you're looking for the type of experience that you can only get by working with me locally, no matter where you're moving to or from, start by contacting me. Whether you're from my hometown in Michigan or from Boston, where we just completed our executive MBA at M.I.T., or from any other city or even around the world, **reach out to me first, and let me see if I can vet out an amazing agent for you.**

What's in it for me? I only want you to have an amazing experience. It breaks my heart when people have negative real estate experiences. I'm not perfect by any means, but I love the opportunity to find a match that's right for you. You're not bothering me; it's a pleasure for me.&nbsp;

One of my favorite things in the world is connecting people I know with people I know. It brings me great joy, so if you need real estate anywhere in the country or anywhere in the world, send me a quick note. Let me listen to what you're looking for and find the match. It would be my pleasure to answer any real estate questions, big or small. Call or email me anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
