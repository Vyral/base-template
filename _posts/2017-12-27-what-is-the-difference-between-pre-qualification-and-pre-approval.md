This is the first submission of a 10-part series on how to purchase your home, so be sure to stay tuned to see the rest of the series. Today’s topic is a discussion on the difference between pre-approval and pre-qualification.

There is a big misunderstanding surrounding these two terms, and in the industry, there is a huge difference between them.

Pre-qualification means:

* You’ve met and spoken with a lender.
* You’ve told them a little bit about your credit score.
* **The lender hasn’t done much to ascertain that you are completely pre-approved.**

Pre-approval means:

* You’ve given the lender your proof of income and bank statements.
* They’ve sourced your down payments.
* They’ve run your credit report.
* **An underwriter, who has the authority of the bank to give you a loan, has approved you.**

Pre-approval carries much more weight when you’re out shopping for a home. It is absolutely critical to be pre-approved before shopping for homes. It will save you a lot of heartache and frustration.

<br>Our next topic will be all about credit, and how important it really is to get you pre-approved. I hope you’ll join us then!
