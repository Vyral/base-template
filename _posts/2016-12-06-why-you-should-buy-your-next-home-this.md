Today we're discussing why, contrary to popular belief, fall and winter is actually a perfect time to buy a home.

Are the fall and winter months a good time to buy a home? This is a question I get quite often.

 You might be surprised to hear that **it's actually a perfect time to buy a home.** Why? For starters, home prices are normally lower at this time of the year. Stats from RealtyTrac analysis from more than 32 million home sales show that buyers who purchased a home in October paid 2.64% below estimated value. That great deal you're looking for could be out there this time of year.

 Additionally, there is **less competition** on the market since there are fewer homes for sale. Simply put, this means there will be fewer buyers out and about. Also consider that the holidays are right around the corner. Sellers who had their homes on the market during the summer probably want to be out of their house and into their new one before the holidays hit, so they are motivated to sell. You'll have the added bonus of moving into your new home before the holidays, too.

Finally, there are year-end tax credits to be taken advantage of. There are credits for buying a house before the end of the year as opposed to waiting for next year.

If you have any other questions about buying in the fall or winter months or you're ready to buy now, give us a call or send us an email. We'd be happy to help!
