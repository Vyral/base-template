Today, I want to share some information about a program that we are doing this year. With every closing we have in 2018, we are donating money to the **[Nevada Humane Society.](http://nevadahumanesociety.org) **

Our program is called Help Save the Kitty, and you can go to [**HelpSavetheKitty.com**](https://www.helpsavethekitty.com/) to get more information about it. 

We took a tour of the facility and there were a lot of things I didn’t know and quite a few that impressed me.  

For example, it’s basically a no-kill shelter. The only time euthanization is done is when it is merciful to the animal. Otherwise, **they go to extremes to help any animal that comes to the Nevada Humane Society.**

The animals do have to come from a Washoe County resident. Other than that, it doesn’t matter what condition the animal is in or what kind of animal it is. They’ve helped a cow, a horse, and a variety of different animals. 

Another thing that impressed me was that they have a vet at the facility in case an animal needs care. If there is an extreme case, they will outsource the animal to another vet.

If an animal needs 24-hour care, they will foster the animal out until the animal is able to stay in the facility. 

If they get a pair of bonded animals, such as two cats or two dogs, **they keep the animals in the facility together and make sure the animals get adopted together.**

If there are behavioral issues, they work with the prison so that prisoners can work with the animals to alleviate any behavioral issues and help the animals get adopted. 

The Nevada Humane Society does so many things to care for animals and get them into a good home. Touring the facility was overwhelming and heartwarming, and the facility was honestly immaculate. 

So, for every closing we have in 2018, we will make a donation to the Nevada Humane Society. If we hit our goal for the number of closings we want to do in 2018, we will donate an additional $2,500 to the Nevada Humane Society. 

Again, you can check out [**HelpSavetheKitty.com**](https://www.helpsavethekitty.com/) to learn more about how you can help us help them. If you or anyone you know is interested in buying or selling a home in 2018, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
