Today I want to let you know about the two simple questions that I give to all of my home buying clients. They’re pretty simple:

**1\. How long do you see yourself staying in that property for?**<br>**2\. How upset will you or your significant other be if you do not get the property?**

People buy and sell real estate because life happens. People have kids, have more kids, and then those kids leave home. **If you plan on staying in your property for a long time, my advice might be different for you than if you think you might be relocated in the next few years.** If that’s the case, renting might make more sense.

**Next, we look at how unique the property you're looking at might be.** If you’re looking in a townhome community and all the homes are pretty similar, there will probably be another one that will come along in the next few months.

If you’re looking at a grand, historic property that only comes on the market once a year, you might be hurting a little more if you missed out on it.

So what are the properties you’re looking for like? The big question you should be asking yourself whether you will outgrow it in the next few years or not.

I’d love to discuss your personal situation to get you some even better advice. If you have any questions for me about buying a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
