Welcome back to another segment of “Casey’s Corner”\!&nbsp;

In our third and final installment of this edition, we’re joined by my friend Rachael Blackwell—a 15-year veteran of the dental field and dental hygienist since 2010. Throughout her career, she’s seen numerous products come on the market, only to later be replaced by others.&nbsp;

Not too long ago, a newly introduced whitening toothpaste was brought to her attention by a neighbor who was selling it. This particular person urged her to do the same, but at the time, she declined. She’s since had a change of heart, and today she’s here to teach us about this product and dental hygiene in general. &nbsp;&nbsp;
