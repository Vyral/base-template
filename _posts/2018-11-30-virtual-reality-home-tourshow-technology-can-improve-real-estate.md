With the technological advances of the past few years, 3D modeling has provided many industries with tools and opportunities for advancement. Real estate is no different: Using 3D models to give buyers virtual tours of homes has been tremendously successful.

**How does it work?**

We use a camera that spins around on axis inside a property, taking multiple pictures from all angles and a computer program stitches it all together to render a 3D model of the home.&nbsp;

This is a big deal for the industry. With this, someone sitting all the way across the country can take a tour of the house from the comfort of their own chair. **That allows you to widen the pool of potential buyers looking at your home**, enticing them without having to make them travel a long way to view it. 3D modeling can mean the difference between going through 20 showings before getting an offer and going through just five before an offer is made.&nbsp;

With virtual reality, **you can hold your first and second showings virtually, meaning that process will go much quicker.** Likely, there will be an in-person tour following these virtual showings, just so the potential buyer can be sure that they’re getting what has been advertised. But overall, 3D modeling can speed up the process and pave the way for a more successful home sale.

If you have any questions about incorporating 3D tours into a home sale or about selling a home in general, you are always encouraged to reach out to the White Group. We’d love to help.
