Have you heard that the Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates again by 75 basis points? If you’re looking to buy a home, you’re probably frustrated by this news, but I have some information to share with you that might soften the blow.&nbsp;

In reality, **interest rates and mortgage rates are correlated, but they don’t follow each other exactly.** Yes, higher interest rates mean that mortgage rates will probably increase, but they won’t go up by the full 0.75%.
