Cody and Steph recently purchased a home and happily agreed to share their experience working alongside our real estate team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We were able to make time for them in the late evening after they finished up at work and discuss their situation in depth. We talked about what locations they were considering and what they wanted most out of a house.&nbsp;

Cody amnd Steph communicated that having enough space for their two dogs was really important to them. The house they fell in love with had a sprawling backyard perfect for two energetic dogs.&nbsp;

The couple had compiled a list of three homes they intended to look at, but my partner Abel suggested checking out another nearby property that fit their criteria. Though they were reluctant to see it in person, they were glad they did:&nbsp;

“It was just exactly everything that we wanted… We didn't need to look any more. **Our home buying process with Alex and Abel was super smooth and not stressful**,” Steph said. “They explained all the paperwork to us and all of the other little details that you don’t normally get from other real estate agents, at least according to my friends who used other agents.”&nbsp;

“What is important to me is that even though I didn’t know what I wanted, Abel thought, ‘They’re going to like this,’ and when I saw it, I said ‘I love this house,’” said Cody.&nbsp;

“Alex’s and Abel’s wife even helped us pick out the tile in our kitchen because I was gone for military training and Steph needed someone’s opinion,” Cody said.&nbsp;

**By listening to their needs, we were able to get Cody and Steph into a home that fits their needs and gives them joy**. If you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell a home this year, please feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We’d love to sit down with you and hear about your unique situation, just like we did for Cody and Steph.&nbsp;
