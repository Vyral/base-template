<center><em>You don&rsquo;t need a massive down payment to afford a home. Here are a few of the different options you have.</em></center>

<br>Regardless of what you may have heard, you do not need 20% down to buy a home. There are a ton of different loan programs out there that offer a variety of down payment options and can cater to your needs as a homebuyer.

In the Salt Lake Valley, there are over 13 cities. Each of these cities may have a different grant or loan program in addition to those available through private lenders. **There are so many options available besides the traditional 20% down**.

The point is that you don’t need a fortune to buy a home. In fact, there are some options that don’t even require a down payment.
