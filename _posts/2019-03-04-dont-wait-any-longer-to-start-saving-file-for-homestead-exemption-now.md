If you’ve purchased a home toward the end of last year and haven’t yet filed for homestead exemption, now is the time to do so.

This exemption, which is available to all Texas homeowners, is easy to apply for and presents incredible tax benefits. **All you need to do is fill out this form and bring it to your county courthouse.&nbsp;**

However, there are a couple of stipulations. To qualify, you must have lived in your home as a primary residence by January 1 of this year. If you weren’t living in your home by then, you’ll need to wait until next year to apply.

**Even if this exemption only saves you a couple hundred dollars each year, any savings is worthwhile.**&nbsp;It all adds up.

There are also other exemptions available for those who qualify, so be sure to take advantage of any that might apply to you.
