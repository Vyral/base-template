You should have already received in the mail your county’s assessment of your home’s value for 2017. Here’s what to do if you think it’s too high.

</div>

We’re nearing the end of the summer, which means that your TRIM notice from your county containing the proposed assessed value of your home for tax purposes in 2017 has been sent out.

**It’s not a bill that you have to pay, but it is something that you are going to want to open and read carefully.** If you feel that your assessed value is unfairly high, or that you are entitled to an exemption that you have not received, you do have the right to contest it with the county appraiser’s office. However, you only have a short time period in which to do this so acting fast is key.

If you need some advice, give us a call or send us an email and we would be glad to help. It’s important to know that this assessment may not reflect what your home would sell for today on the open market—if you need to know what your home would sell for, just call us, and we’re happy to discuss what your home is worth.

If you have questions about how the Property Appraiser determines an assessed value for your home, check out the informative discussions at each of the county websites:

<a href="https://www.hcpafl.org/" target="_blank">Hillsborough County Property Appraiser website</a>
<a href="http://www.pascopa.com/" target="_blank">Pasco County Property Appraiser website</a>
<a href="http://www.pcpao.org/" target="_blank">Pinellas County Property Appraiser website</a>

Remember, if you feel your assessment is unfairly high or a mistake has been made, you have the statutory right to appeal it.  Keep in mind that you only have a short time to do so, so don't wait. Here are some helpful links:
