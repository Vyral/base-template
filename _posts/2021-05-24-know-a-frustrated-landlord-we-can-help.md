We’ve been hearing from a lot of landlords who are struggling to find tenants and just fed up with a lot of the aspects of property management. Some landlords are dealing with a bit of disaster at the moment, so today we wanted to offer some advice as the owners of a property management company with over 300 houses. If your tenant has left your home in disaster and you don’t want to put all that money back in to rent it out again, we’d love to have a conversation with you. **We might be able to net you the same amount of cash that you’re used to while also getting rid of all those headaches of being a landlord.**

Another big topic is tenant’s rights. The eviction moratorium is supposed to come up in June. If it is allowed to expire, we want to make sure you’re prepared and know what to do. If you have a tenant who hasn’t been paying rent, we know of solutions that can help you get some of that money back.

If you’re a frustrated landlord or know someone who is, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We’d love to offer our expert advice.
