So you’re in the market for a house, but there’s nothing to see out there.

I have a couple of clients who were in the same predicament recently—they were looking for a house that doesn’t exist.&nbsp;

What did we do? **I put on my walking shoes, took some notes, gathered some personal brochures, and started door-knocking on a street they were interested in.&nbsp;**

For each person who answered the door, I introduced myself, explained that my buyers were interested in buying on that street, and asked if there was any chance they were selling soon.&nbsp;

Can you guess what happened? Well, two people ended up inviting me in, and one of them did want to sell their house.&nbsp;

If you’re only looking at what’s listed online or what’s being advertised and your agent isn’t knocking on doors trying to find homes that aren’t “available,” **you need to call an agent who will.** I would love to go house hunting for you.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about finding homes in a tough market or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;
