You want to increase the value of your home, right? Here are five easy ways that you can do that:

**1\. Improve curb appeal.** Mow the lawn, mulch the flowerbeds, and make sure everything looks sharp.

**2\. Apply a fresh coat of paint.** This is a cost-efficient way to spruce up the inside of your house and make it look like new.

**3\. Do minor repairs.** You don't have to spend a lot of money. Even simple repairs can go a long way.

**4\. Deep clean.** Wash the baseboards, and clean the carpets and windows. Your home needs to shine and show buyers that it is in good condition.

**5\. Declutter.** Go through closets and rooms to sort out what you need and what you don’t. This is your chance to jump-start your move and get stuff out of the house. The more clutter you have, the smaller the rooms look.
