As busy as we agents can get, we sometimes need help showing to buyer clients and hosting open houses.&nbsp;

**That’s why my team and I came up with the idea of having showing and open house partners**—so we can leverage our time better and help our clients at the highest level.&nbsp;

How does it work? We work with agents who agree to our standards and expectations of working with people. Communication is key when working with these agents. We have a plan and agreement in place, and we make sure they communicate with us as soon as the open house or showing ends so we can update our clients and make sure they’re taken care of.

**There are pros and cons to this system.** One of the pros is that we’re able to help our clients faster. One of the cons is that we’re the ones who have to make sure that our clients’ expectations are met. This system is risk-free in terms of bringing people into your world and onto your team, but you don’t have 100% control over how they work in the field when dealing with clients.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that, by doing this, our agents can serve more clients and our clients are better taken care of—that’s what matters to us.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about showing and open house partners or if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
