How do you price your home in today's market? If you're thinking of selling your house in our current market, you should know that things are quite different than they were earlier this year or last year. Interest rates are significantly higher, there's a rise in inventory, and now there's more competition among sellers.

Currently, we’re seeing offers coming in below the asking prices, and buyers are typically asking sellers for seller concessions. This is a significant change from what we've been previously seeing. However, this is the direction the market is going in.

As a seller, you need to look at the market with your real estate professional and determine what the prices are in your neighborhood and, therefore, where you need to be. **My recommendation is to be at or slightly below the most recent comparable sale** so that you're attracting buyers and not shooting for the sky or wasting your time. The longer a home sits, the lower the price it eventually sells for.

If you have any questions about this or would like to talk about a strategy for your home, I would love to talk with you\! Reach out through phone call or email anytime.
