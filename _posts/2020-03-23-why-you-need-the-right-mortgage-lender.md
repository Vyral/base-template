<center><em>The spring real estate market has been hot for a few months now. Matt Nader joined us to talk about how he&rsquo;s helping.</em></center>

&nbsp;

During the course of any given year, we talk about whether or not the spring market will creep into February. **This year, the real estate market got hot around New Year's and has remained so ever since**.

Here’s an example of what’s going on. We just had a conversation with a client who didn’t have all their ducks in a row yet, but was pleasantly surprised when we told them what their home could fetch in the current market. To make sure they were ready to sell and buy their next home, the next step was getting him in touch with Matt.

According to Matt from First Home Mortgage, speed kills in this industry and in this market. If you can work with someone like him who knows how to write a contract in this market to give you the best chance of getting your offer accepted, that’s a huge benefit to sellers to pick you.

Getting your ducks in a row helps you put your best foot forward and shows sellers how much you want to purchase their home. **Not only does this provide security to the sellers, but it also allows buyers to speed up their timelines if possible**.

If a homebuyer is out there and ready to write an offer on a home, Matt can close in as fast as 13 days, with an average of 21-22 days. The industry average is around a month. Matt can help buyers shorten the transaction, which gives sellers more security.

**The market is changing drastically all the time**. There are a lot of unknowns that come with volatility. Real estate is and always will be a relationship-based business, and it’s nice to have someone like Matt to talk to and get in the best position possible. If you have any questions for him, give him a call at (240) 882-8006 or <u><a target="_blank" href="http://themattnadergroup.com">visit his website</a></u>.
