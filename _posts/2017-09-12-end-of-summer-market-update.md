We’re at the end of summer already and heading into fall. I wanted to quickly touch base with you about what we saw in the real estate market this summer and what we can expect over the next couple months.

**Home sales are up 10% overall, but we saw a bit of a buyer slowdown in mid-July.**That leaves us with 471 homes on the market right now, with 200 of them being new homes.

With almost half of our listings being new construction homes, buyers have options. They can pick a brand-new home with great incentives and custom finishes. **If you’re thinking of selling your home this fall, you’ll need to stage it and price it aggressively to compete with those model homes.**

If you’re thinking about buying or selling anytime in the near future, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
