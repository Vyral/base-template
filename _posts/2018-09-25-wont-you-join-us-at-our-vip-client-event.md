I’m aboard a gorgeous boat today on the Louisville riverfront at a client party for Swan Financial and I want to take this time to invite you to our very special client party on October 13 at 6 p.m. But first, I have some real estate news.

We have seen the market slow dramatically. We were so hot for so long that this slowdown has brought us down to equilibrium. Things are starting to get back to normal in our real estate market. If you’re looking to buy a home, now might be the perfect time for you to do so. If you’re thinking about selling, there are fewer homes on the market right now, which means less competition for you.

In the video above, you can see Slugger Field in the distance. **On October 13, we want to invite you, our VIP clients, to Louisville City soccer game at Slugger Field.** If you haven’t been yet, this is the perfect opportunity to have some fun and enjoy a night out here in the city.

This is a limited time offer because we only have so many tickets. **We need to hear from you immediately so we can reserve your tickets.** We have 300 tickets available and it’s first-come first-served. [Follow this link to RSVP so we can confirm your attendance.](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07efpasinz5211c6eb&amp;oseq=&amp;c=&amp;ch=)

We’re very excited for this event, especially after recently attending Swan Financial’s client appreciation event, which you can learn more about in the video above. It was a great way for them to thank their staff, loan officers, and clients. We had a lovely time on the boat as well.

If you have any questions for me about the upcoming event or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
