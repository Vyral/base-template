Need ideas for something to do with a small space in your home? Try these three great, easy tips:<br>&nbsp;

**1. Choosing the right paint.** Using colors like neutrals, whites, creams, and grays can make a room feel larger than it really is. Pairing the right lighting and paint color is also very important; be sure to choose lighting that will enhance your colors, and avoid those bulbs and colors that cause glares.

**2. Use high shelving in closets for those rarely used items.** Also utilize high ceilings and walls for guitars, surfboards, or any item that can double as decoration.

**3. Use furniture for storage.** Don’t have a lot of floor space? Use tables and benches with hidden storage compartments. Crates, boxes, and containers that are low in depth but wide are great for under-bed storage.
