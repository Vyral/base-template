Today I want to revisit a topic we spoke about briefly in one of our previous blogs, and that’s the idea of being a fiduciary and transferring your liability.

**Liability as a fiduciary is a result of function, not a result of title.** There are so many providers and marketing services relating to record keepers and advisors, but I’m going to reference an article from an attorney who specializes in these types of issues today.

The article is called “Making Sense of the Numbers” and it’s a simple article that weighs out the idea of your ability as a plan sponsor to transfer some of the liability that you have as result of the function of being a fiduciary.

**As a fiduciary, you are obligated to a duty of loyalty and a duty of prudence.** The article I mentioned above talks about your ability to transfer your liability.

If you’re an individual fiduciary or as part of a committee, you do have the ability to transfer your liability in three specific ways. The (3) 16, a plan administrator transfer of fiduciary liability, the (3) 21 and the (3) 38. The (3) 38 is the Cadillac of fiduciaries, but each of these represents different things.

If you have any questions about any of these ways to transfer your liability or anything else related to being a plan sponsor or fiduciary, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.
