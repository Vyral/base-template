This summer posed a significant environmental challenge for Flathead Lake, a concern that many of you have raised in your questions. We experienced an exceptionally hot and dry season, leading to substantially lower-than-average rainfall â€“ about 80% below the norm. This resulted in low river and stream flows and a severely impacted lake ecosystem.

**A notable consequence of these conditions was Flathead Lake not reaching its full pool level.** This situation escalated to the point where boat owners faced difficulties; some boats were even stranded on the lake due to rapidly dropping water levels. The need to prematurely winterize boats was an unexpected and disheartening outcome for many.

In response to this crisis, I joined an initiative dedicated to preventing such occurrences in the future. The problem wasn't a lack of water; it was a matter of management. This led to the formation of a group known as the [National Organization to Save Flathead Lake](https://fillthelake.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Their mission is to collaborate with regulators and lawmakers to implement a long-overdue drought management plan. This plan, though completed a decade ago, was never integrated into the dam's operating permit, leading to the current predicament.

**Our objective is to maintain Flathead Lake at full pool during the summer and manage water levels responsibly throughout the year.** This approach considers the variety of water needs, not only in our immediate area but also upstream at Hungry Horse and downstream towards the Pacific Ocean.

To support this cause, I encourage you to visit the organization's website. They are actively seeking contributions to hire professionals who can help advance this initiative. Ensuring we don't face similar surprises in the future requires community support and expertise.
