There have been a few industry trends we have noticed in the marketplace lately, so today we would like to discuss these recent developments.

**1. Dining is becoming more and more important.** As the customer-service approach becomes more prevalent in our industry, this aspect of care has seen an increased level of emphasis. Some communities are even opening up access to in-facility restaurants to the public. This helps to boost credibility and serves as a powerful marketing tool.

**2. Younger resident demographics are becoming a more highly focused-upon target.** Expectations of care for these demographics are somewhat different from what is the standard for older residents. This shift in focus definitely highlights how our industry is beginning to pay closer attention to higher standards of care in general. Coupled with that, the industry is allocating more effort into diversifying the kind of care that is available. While some seniors may prefer a more traditional assisted-living experience, other seniors are interested in a more active lifestyle.

**3. Industry standards are shifting toward a more customized approach.** As we briefly touched upon in the previous point, the industry is beginning to focus on creating an experience that is tailored to resident needs and demographics.

**4. Care is becoming more affordable.** Communal living and other similar options have made things less expensive than in the past.
