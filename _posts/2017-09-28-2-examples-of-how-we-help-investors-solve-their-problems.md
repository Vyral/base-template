Helping real estate investors overcome any challenges they face is something our team specializes in. Two recent transactions we worked on exemplify our commitment to helping people in commercial real estate.

The first case comes from an investor who purchased a nine-unit property—a seven-unit apartment complex with a duplex attached to it—for roughly $100,000 30 years ago in an area called German Village right here in Columbus. This property has seen significant appreciation, and we estimated it to be worth almost $1 million.

This investor came to us wondering how he could use the equity he had in his property. We went through a couple different scenarios with him, and in the end he decided he wanted to sell the apartment complex to another investor for cash. We were then able to locate a condo developer who agreed to buy the complex with the intent of splitting those nine units into condos and selling them individually at a higher price.

In this example,** we were able to bring both sides together and facilitate the transaction.**This first client went on to invest his money with his proceeds and purchase another 10 to 20 properties. Even not as a condo project, this was a great investment property because it was located in a class A area.

The second case involves a larger, more sophisticated investor who owned over 500 units. He had an asset he wanted to free up to purchase an 18-unit property that he’d just come across in the Short North area. The asset he wanted to free up was a building he purchased and managed to turn into a highly profitable investment. Because of the equity he had in that investment, it made sense to him to cash out.

This investor contacted us looking for a buyer, and we put him in contact with a larger investment group who owned a lot of real estate around the OSU campus and was looking to expand into the Short North area. They ended up buying the building from him.

Once again, we facilitated both sides of the transaction. On the one hand, we were able to help our client free up his cash to purchase another commercial building. On the other hand, we were able to help the investment group meet their acquisition strategy.

**The common theme in both of these examples is our ability to solve problems and manage transactions** so that all parties involved walk away in a better position than they were in beforehand. The size of the deal doesn’t matter—we’re here to help people meet their challenges.

If you have an acquisition strategy and you want us to be a part of it, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
