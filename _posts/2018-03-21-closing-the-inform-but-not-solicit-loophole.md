  Since the major announcements that several firms would be leaving the Broker
  Protocol, how are advisors faring in terms of being able to move to new firms?
  Many have been subject to legal action, especially those from UBS and Morgan
  Stanley. There is a loophole that advisors have been using in an attempt to
  keep their clients, however, and firms are taking action to close that
  loophole up. To hear more, watch my latest video.

In a post-protocol world, how successful have advisors been in moving to different firms?<br><br>With special emphasis on those from UBS and Morgan Stanley, **many advisors have been subject to legal action once they’ve left their firms** because the firms have decided to depart from the Broker Protocol.

These advisors are contacting their clients with information they’ve gathered from public sources—in the grand scheme of the discourse surrounding this shift, this is an important nuance. **They’re only contacting those clients, not soliciting them.**

For example, an advisor who has chosen to leave Morgan Stanley might contact a client and say, “I just wanted to let you know that I have departed Morgan Stanley and have decided to join XYZ Brokerage Firm.” Then, I would stop, silent.

In a perfect world, the client would respond, saying that they’d follow you to your new brokerage. In that circumstance, the advisor would be free to send the appropriate paperwork to open up the account and initiate a transfer.

How are firms fighting back against that? The UBS essentially struck the first blow.

UBS announced that they would be putting into their 2019 deferred comp agreement that **in order for advisors to get the money they earned in 2018, they would have to sign in agreement to the following:**

*"‘Solicit’, as set forth in this paragraph, means that the employee will not initiate, whether directly or indirectly, any contact or communication of any kind whatsoever for the purpose of inviting, encouraging, or requesting a client where that my have the effect of advising, encouraging, or requesting a client transfer his or her UBS accounts to another institution."*

According to my attorney, this is among the most effective non-solicit agreements that he has ever seen. **This will close the “Inform, But Not Solicit” loophole.** And it is a loophole; advisors are calling and informing their clients of their move, without the protection of the protocol, with the intention of having that client move.

But the courts don’t yet understand the nuances of this industry. This is just another way for the firms to fight back—to try to keep their advisors in their seats.
