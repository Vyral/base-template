Valentine’s Day is coming up very quickly, and we at the Misty SOLD Team are here to help you with your gift-giving. **100 winners will get a box of chocolate and a bottle of champagne through our “Share the Love” giveaway.** Three people will also win a Valentine’s Day dinner for two at a local restaurant.&nbsp;

**To enter, all you need to do is text LOVE to 35620.** There will be two pickup days, February 11 and February 14, at our West Des Moines (9325 Bishop Drive, Suite 110) and Indianola (117 E Salem Avenue) locations from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp;

We also need to thank our amazing sponsors for helping us put together this event to spread the love. **Thanks to Home Warranty of America, Des Moines Area Roofing, The Simmons-Hemer Team at Motto Mortgage, and Erick Bokker and Pat Conway of Bank Central.** This wouldn’t have been possible without all of them.

Give us a text today and get your Valentine’s Day gift-giving done early. If you have any questions or real estate-related needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
