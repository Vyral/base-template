North Carolina recently brought back its $15,000 grant program. This is a great program for first-time home buyers. I’ll go over a few important details for you today.

Today I have some great news for North Carolina home buyers: the $15,000 grant program is back!

**If you’re a first-time home buyer or if you haven’t owned a home in the last three years, you may be eligible for this program.**

Basically, the state will give you $15,000 towards down payment assistance, closing costs, and/or buying the loan amount down.

There are a few requirements that you have to meet in order to qualify for this program.

First of all, you cannot make over a certain amount of money. Check in with your lender for the details. Secondly, you have to buy a home in the $240,000 to $245,000 price range.

**This is a great program for first-time home buyers.** I certainly wish it was around back when I bought my home!

If you are working with one of our agents already, they know tons about this program. Make sure you ask them about it.

If you’re not a first-time home buyer but you know someone who is, make sure that they are looking in Mecklenburg or Cabarrus County in order to qualify for this program.

Last October, 3,000 grants were issued to home buyers. **There are not many left today.** Get in touch with us to take advantage of this great loan program. We would be happy to help you!
