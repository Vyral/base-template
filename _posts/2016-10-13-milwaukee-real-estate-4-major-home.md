There are four major mistakes that buyers make during the process of buying a home. These are general mistakes that buyers make whether they're buying their first, second, or third home:

**1. Not getting pre-approved** for financing before looking at homes. This process is very simple: contact a local lender and, within 48 hours, you can get pre-approved over the phone or Internet. There is no cost or obligation, so I highly recommend you do this first. You'll also know what you can afford and what the costs are. Smart sellers will require you to have a pre-approval letter anyway.

**2. Getting pre-approved by on out-of-state or online lender.** With these lenders, you can't talk to them in person. Your lender is someone you'll want to have face-to-face contact with. I see a lot of people using these online services because they offer a cheaper rate, and it's a big mistake. I've heard too many horror stories about these lenders not being able to process a loan in time. Call your real estate agent for a recommendation for a local bank or mortgage company.

**3. Not having a full-time agent.** You want someone who does this as their full-time job actively looking for homes with you. There are all kinds of online searches you can use, like Zillow and Trulia, that are not very accurate and are not rated well by the Better Business Bureau. You want to have a full-time agent looking with you because many times that agent knows about listings before even going online.

**4. Not having an experienced agent writing the offer and negotiating on your behalf.** Many buyers just pick any agent or work with the listing agent of the home they're buying. You want someone who is working on your behalf to write the offer with your best interests in mind, and then negotiate the best price for you.

If you have any questions about the home buying process or you're interested in buying a home, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to hear from you!
