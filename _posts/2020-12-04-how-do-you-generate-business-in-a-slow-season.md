<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you want to drum up more business right now, here are the ways to do it.</em></p>

What are the fastest ways to generate immediate business in a slow season? Here are three tips you can try:

**1\. Contact your sphere of influence.** Everyone knows about 250 people, so document the people you know, like, and trust, and reach out to them. A certain percentage of the population will buy or sell a house this year, and the people who already trust you will give you referrals if you give them value and ask them who they know who might be buying, selling, or investing in real estate in the next 12 months. If you do that with a couple hundred people, I guarantee you’ll have prospects to follow up with immediately.&nbsp;

**2\. Contact people with expired listings or those trying to sell on their own (FSBO).** These people have already reached their selling window, so you know they’re motivated (at least to some extent). Call them right away or start door-knocking and give them twice as much value as what you’re asking. That’s always been my motto, and when you do this over and over again, you’ll be surprised at how much business you’re inundated with.

**3\. Contact open house attendees.** Just as owners of expired listings or FSBOs are already motivated to sell, most people attending an open house are likely entering a buying window. Some will be more motivated than others, but there’s no better way to build trust and rapport than getting face to face with someone at an open house. If you do that for the next couple of Sundays and market that open house well, I guarantee you’ll have a couple more prospects who’ll eventually turn into clients that’ll take your business to the next level.&nbsp;
