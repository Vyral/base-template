Today I’m going to tell you the best way to give an empty room a purpose when selling your home.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

When selling your home, the last thing you want to show is a room that appears to have no use. I have the perfect solution to share with you today.

So what can you do with a spare room? **Put a bed in it. It’s that simple.** Putting a bed in a spare room will make it look occupied and lived in. It doesn’t matter what floor the spare room is on or if it has windows. Put a bed in it. That’s the best way to give an empty room a purpose and you’ll have the use of a guest room in the meantime.
