Moving can be a stressful process for you and your family, so here are some things to keep in mind and tips to follow to make your move as seamless as possible.

First, who’s going to help you move? Will you call in a few favors from some family and friends or call a professional moving company? If you’d rather use a professional moving company, we recommend Move Buddies. They do a wonderful job, and I even used them for my own move. You can get in touch with them by visiting [www.movebuddies.com](https://www.movebuddies.com/) or calling them directly at (843) 972-9039.

Second, you need to prepare for the big day. Oftentimes, moving companies can come by and estimate how many boxes it will take to haul your stuff, and they can also bring their own boxes ahead of time so you can start packing. Sometimes, they’ll even help you pack those boxes, depending on what level of service you request from them. In any case, make sure you have plenty of boxes.

Keep in mind that what you have in a guest bedroom in your old house might not necessarily go in a guest bedroom in your new house. Floor plans vary and can change how you may organize that new room. The best thing you can do in this case is label everything ahead of time and specify where it’s going in the new house. This way, you won’t have people constantly asking you “Where does this go?” on moving day.

Organizing the move on the day of the move is another important task. Consider where the moving truck is going to go—are there parking spaces available or a driveway that will be cleared for it? What needs to happen to get that moving truck as close to the front door as possible?

Once the moving starts, it goes fast, but unloading the truck takes a lot longer than loading it, so make sure you have plenty of drinks and snack on hand so when your moving crew comes over, they can focus on the task at hand.

If you have any more questions about how to make your move seamless or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
