There are thousands of people on my website, www.northernvahomefinder.com, where you can find many different houses, set favorites, and narrow down the things you’re looking for in a home.

However, I notice that a lot of people using this search site aren’t entirely serious about buying yet.

For many, you’ve gotten to know me over time. Despite the valuable information my team and I are sending out, we’ve found that **93% of the phone calls we make go unanswered by people using our website.**

This is all simply because people sometimes don’t feel ready to move forward. In any real estate transaction, you have to feel ready.

It’s not about when I’m ready- it’s about when you are. But, I’d like to propose something to you: **get serious sooner.**

Right now is a great time to buy a home and I’d love to help. My team and I have so many resources for you to use as you move forward with the search for your next home.

I’d be happy to put you in touch with a great lender who will counsel you. Rather than damaging your credit, they will help you over the long term.

The only way for you to get the house you want is for you to get serious about doing so. **So, next time I call, don’t be afraid to pick up!**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
