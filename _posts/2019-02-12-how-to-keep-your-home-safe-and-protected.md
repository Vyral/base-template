<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Is your home prepared for the worst? If not, here’s to start.</em></p>

I receive a lot of questions about home security, especially in regard to alarm systems. Today I’ll be going over three of these systems and share a tip for online security.&nbsp;

**Here are some home systems I recommend:**

**1. Burglar alarm.** This will detect when there’s an intruder in your home. However, this doesn’t often work as well in rural areas, as response times from law enforcement can be much longer than in more urban environments. Video surveillance can work well to find intruders later, however.

**2. Temperature sensor.** If there’s a power outage and you’re out of the home, this sensor will notify you when the home is approaching a freezing temperature.

**3. Water sensor.** It doesn’t even have to be freezing outside for your water pipes to break. Sometimes, the ice maker in a refrigerator can malfunction and cause damage.&nbsp;

**What about cybersecurity?** With social media, there are a lot of things that can happen that threaten your privacy. Things you post can be passed along to people you don’t know—do you really want the world to see? Let’s say you’re taking a vacation and post online about it; now everyone knows your house is empty for a week. Hold off on posting about your vacation until you’re back at home.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, need more information, or have any ideas you’d like to add, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
