Here’s a look at the options available for today’s self-employed buyers.

Before I get started, I wanted to give you a little advice if you have an investment property and you want to tap into that equity.

{% include pullquote.html %}

You can always do so through traditional financing with a big bank, but there are other options. For example, there are equity-based programs where we look at the income being produced by the property to qualify you for a cash-out refinance. **Right now, we’re going all the way up to 70% loan-to-value on those programs.**

One of the groups that have been hit hardest by COVID is self-employed individuals. If you’re self-employed and need a mortgage, you can get one through traditional financing, bank statement loans, or another option. **We can actually work with self-employed investors to take their bank statements, look at the deposits, and come up with an average that we use as income to qualify them.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions for me about buying a home, investing, or refinancing, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
