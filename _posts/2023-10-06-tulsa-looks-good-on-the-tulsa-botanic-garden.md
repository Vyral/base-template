Jennie connected with Director of Communication and Outreach, Lori Hutson to hear all about how life is more colorful out at the Tulsa Botanic Garden!

Located on 170 acres, the gardens are located northwest of downtown Tulsa in Osage County. With the mission to promote the beauty and importance of plants and nature to create a more sustainable and harmonious world, the gardenâ€™s offers something for all ages.

Throughout the year the Botanic Garden offers a variety of classes and workshops on topics ranging from storytime for kiddos to gardening to infusing cocktails with botanicals. Be sure to visit their [calendar](https://www.tulsabotanic.org/botanic-events/calendar/) for a full list of upcoming events!

In addition to public events, the gardens provide a beautiful backdrop for private events including weddings, team building, and more!

As a nonprofit, the garden relies on generous donors and volunteers to help this Tulsa attraction continue to bloom.
