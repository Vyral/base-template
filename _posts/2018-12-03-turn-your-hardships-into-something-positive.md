When you’re faced with adversity, challenge yourself to leverage your hardships into strength.

With the holidays approaching, our team has had a lot going on—and we aren’t slowing down any time soon.&nbsp;

Following the recent success of our annual Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway, during which we gave out more pies than ever before, the spirit of giving is stronger than ever among our team members. Because of this, **we’re officially declaring our office as an unofficial Toys for Tots drop-off location.&nbsp;**

If you’re as passionate about giving back as we are, now is your chance to do so. We hope you’ll help us make a difference by dropping off a toy this holiday season. We’ll be happy to deliver it for you. Though the holiday season is supposed to be merry and bright, this isn’t the case for everyone. And this brings me to the topic I’d like to focus on today: adversity.&nbsp;

**It can be easy to start feeling sorry for ourselves when misfortune strikes.** I recently ripped my bicep, for example, and was letting it get me down until I heard a story from one of you that really put things in perspective.&nbsp;

The young woman who reached out to me had more on her plate than I could imagine. She was not only getting divorced, but she was also fighting against breast cancer and leukemia. This woman could have easily let these hardships bring her down, but she didn’t let this happen. Instead, she decided to get on a plane to Africa and spend three months volunteering at an orphanage.

This story absolutely blew me away when I heard it. **It amazed me to hear that even during such a difficult time, this woman was able to leverage adversity into strength**—and that the message I’d like for you to take away from this.&nbsp;

The next time you’re faced with an obstacle, try to shift your perspective toward the things that really matter in life. Of course, you don’t have to wait for hardship to strike to start making a difference. There’s never a bad time to start giving back.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
