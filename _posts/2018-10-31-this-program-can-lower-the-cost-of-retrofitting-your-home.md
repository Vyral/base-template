Here at the Dave Knight Real Estate Team, we love helping people buy and sell homes. I also love saving money, and today’s topic will be tips about how you can save money yourself if you’ve been thinking about retrofitting your home to prepare it for an earthquake.

The credit for this tip goe to my neighbor Jim, who told me about&nbsp;**the** **\*\*EBB**&nbsp;**Program, which stands for ‘Earthquake Brace + Bolt.’\*\*** With this program, you can receive up to a $3,000 credit to help with the cost of bracing and bolting your home during the retrofitting process if you’re in an area where earthquakes are a serious threat.

**In order to take advantage, click [here ](https://www.earthquakebracebolt.com/)to visit the Earthquake Brace + Bolt website and apply for the program.** Your home will need to meet certain criteria, such as being in the proper zip code, not being located on a hillside, and the home must be your primary residence. Once you apply, it’s essentially a lottery system that will give certain people that $3,000 credit. Now, the cost of retrofitting your home this way will be somewhere between $3,000 and $7,000, according to the website, so this credit will take out a large chunk of that expense for you.

If your home isn’t braced or bolted in preparation for an earthquake, **it’s a good idea to start thinking about that now**. It could potentially save you money down the road, should an earthquake strike (knock on wood).

For any further questions about this program or about buying or selling a home, you’re always encouraged to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
