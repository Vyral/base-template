We started the year with low inventory. Since there weren’t many properties available for sale at the beginning of the year, multiple offers came in on every reasonably priced single-family home on the market, which was great for sellers.

<br>There has been a 1.4% increase in sales prices over the last four months, and the average days on market has gone down. In January, homes spent an average of 45 days on market; at the end of April, that number dropped to 27 days.

<br>This tells us that sellers are more inclined to take an offer that has a faster close than the traditional 30-day closing.

<br>If you are a buyer, it’s still a great time to buy. We are within a half point of the lowest interest rates in our market. You should work with a lender who can help you closer in fewer than 30 days in order to make your offer more appealing to sellers. I have lenders who can get you closed in 10 to 14 days.

<br>That said, we are still in a seller’s market.

<br>If you are interested in buying or selling a home, or if you just have more questions about our current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
