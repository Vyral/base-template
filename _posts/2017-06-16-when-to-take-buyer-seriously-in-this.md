When someone says they are just beginning their home search, they could mean a number of different things. Here’s a better question to ask a buyer.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

What does it mean when someone says they are “just starting” their home search? Well, it can mean a lot of things. Your home may actually be the first home they have looked at, or it could be the 50th. There’s a better way to tell if a buyer is serious about buying a home or not.

**If the buyer you talk to is pre-approved for a mortgage and working with a real estate agent, I would take them very seriously.** They could give you your highest offer and if nothing else, they will give you good feedback about your home so you can improve it for the next buyer who comes through.

If the buyer you talk to isn’t working with an agent, doesn’t have a pre-approval, and is just beginning their search, I wouldn’t take them as seriously. It’s likely they wouldn’t be able to make a strong offer anyway.

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
