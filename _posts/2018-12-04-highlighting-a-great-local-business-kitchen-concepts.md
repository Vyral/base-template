Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Jim Means of Kitchen Concepts about his business here in Tulsa. 

Jim has been in working in design since 1994, but it wasn’t until eight years ago that he transformed his business into what it is today. Now, Kitchen Concepts has its own design team and in-house construction staff, which work together on kitchen and bathroom remodel, additions, parties, and more. 

According to Jim, **Kitchen Concepts is “all about you.” **

And as far as price goes, Jim and his team prefer to work within their clients' budgets. From super high-end products to more modest options, there’s something for every price range.

In general, though, Jim says a full kitchen remodel will tend to cost between $50,000 and $70,000. That said, Jim is more than willing to find solutions for clients who can’t afford quite that much. 

**Their showroom is conveniently located in the London South Shopping Center at 5936 S Lewis Avenue.** Walk-ins are welcome during the week, or you can visit by appointment on Saturdays. 

Of course, if you aren’t quite sure what you’re looking for, they would be happy to guide you. Not only does the team at Kitchen Concepts stay on top of current trends, but they also like to focus on functionality. Often, this means opening things up to create more space. 

The bottom line is that Jim and his team at Kitchen Concepts are more than happy to work around your schedule, budget, wants, and needs. As their motto says, the goal of Kitchen Concepts is “Creating a kitchen for the way you live.” 

**If you want to get in touch with Jim and his team, you can reach them by visiting <u><a target="_blank" href="http://kitchenconceptstulsa.com/">www.kitchenconceptstulsa.com</a></u> or by calling (918) 779-4480. **

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information from me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
