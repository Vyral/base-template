Today I have not one, but two fun videos that I wanted to share.

As you may remember back in November, we gave away pies to our loyalty club members for Thanksgiving and gave you a chance to vote on which of our team members deserved a pie in the face.

Well, yours truly was lucky enough to be one of them. You can see me get pied in the face here.

We also gave away a trip to one lucky client, and you can see their video here.

We had a lot of fun in the last few weeks and we’re really looking forward to a great 2017. If there’s anything you have questions about in real estate or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you!
