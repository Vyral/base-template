<center><em>Should you sell your home now or wait? Let me give you some insight.</em></center>

<br>In the past, I probably would have advised you to wait until the snow is gone to sell your home when things are a bit greener and your home will look its best in photos. However, there are a few things working in your favor if you decide to sell right now.

For one, **interest rates have reached historic lows**, meaning more people can afford a more expensive house than they could have in the past. People often purchase based on their monthly payments as opposed to the home’s total purchase price, and because rates are so low, monthly payments are reduced, as well.

**Additionally, demand is at an all-time high**. Home sales in the Calgary region are the highest they’ve been since 2007. We’re not sure how much longer this will last; it may just be a pocket in the market, or it may continue.

**There is also less competition right now**. Inventory is low and demand is high, and in some price ranges, your odds of selling within 90 days are over 100%.

These market conditions are unheard of, so you should strongly consider taking advantage of the times by selling now. If you have any questions about selling your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you formulate a strategy so you can realize your dreams.
