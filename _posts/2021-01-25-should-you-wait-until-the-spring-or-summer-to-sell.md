<center><em>Should you sell your home now or wait? Let me give you some insight.</em></center>

<br>In the past, I probably would have advised you to wait until the snow is gone to sell your home when things are a bit greener and your home will look its best in photos. However, there are a few things working in your favor if you decide to sell right now.

For one, **interest rates have reached historic lows**, meaning more people can afford a more expensive house than they could have in the past. People often purchase based on their monthly payments as opposed to the home‚Äôs total purchase price, and because rates are so low, monthly payments are reduced, as well.

**Additionally, demand is at an all-time high**. Home sales in the Calgary region are the highest they‚Äôve been since 2007. We‚Äôre not sure how much longer this will last; it may just be a pocket in the market, or it may continue.

**There is also less competition right now**. Inventory is low and demand is high, and in some price ranges, your odds of selling within 90 days are over 100%.

These market conditions are unheard of, so you should strongly consider taking advantage of the times by selling now. If you have any questions about selling your home, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me. I‚Äôd love to help you formulate a strategy so you can realize your dreams.

<center><h4><strong>üî• HOT OFF THE PRESS üî•<br />Modest gains in Calgary housing market expected in 2021</strong></h4></center>

<br>**Calgary, Jan. 26, 2021** ‚Äì In 2020, housing markets across the country surprised many with a stronger-than-expected rebound in the second half of the year despite record-high unemployment rates and significant job losses.

Calgary did not hit record-high sales or prices in the third or fourth quarters, but still posted some of the strongest sales relative to the past five years. This was nearly enough to offset the initial losses recorded during the first shutdown caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúIt is expected some of the momentum recorded at the end of 2020 will continue into 2021, fueled by exceptionally low lending rates and pent-up demand,‚Äù said Ann-Marie Lurie, CREB&reg; Chief Economist.

‚ÄúWhile sales are expected to rise by nearly 5% on an annual basis in 2021, persistent economic challenges are expected to prevent stronger growth in our housing market.‚Äù

Reduction in supply relative to sales is the primary reason the Calgary housing market returned to more balanced conditions by the end of 2020. The pullback in new listings relative to sales activity resulted in inventory levels falling to the lowest levels seen in the past several years.

As we move into 2021, we anticipate new listings will start to rise, as COVID-19 likely caused many homeowners to delay listing their homes. We could start to see some supply come back in 2021, as concerns regarding the spread of the virus ease. Persistently high unemployment rates could also weigh on some existing homeowners who may need to sell their homes.

Growth in supply is expected to offset some of the gains in sales, pushing our market to the upper bounds of balanced conditions and slowing price recovery. However, the price gains that occurred at the end of 2020 are not expected to be eroded and 2021 annual prices are forecasted to improve by over 1%.

‚ÄúThis year has been filled with twists and turns all over the world. The Calgary housing market was no exception,‚Äù said Alan Tennant, CREB&reg; President and CEO.
