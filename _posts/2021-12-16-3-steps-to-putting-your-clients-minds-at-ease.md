What do I say? Sometimes it’s not about what you say but how you listen. Speaking the language of real estate is an acquired skill, and it’s one that must be worked on daily. Here are three tips to put your clients’ minds at ease:

**1\. Start by asking questions and listening.** Everyone wants to feel heard and know that their thoughts are appreciated and understood. Building rapport and connection starts immediately. Ask them how they see this whole process going and what a move would look like to them in a perfect world. By their response, you’ll know exactly how much they do and don’t know about the process, which will help you serve them better.

**2\. Map out the process.** Once you’re in alignment with your clients, map out the process as you help them imagine their future and manage expectations. For example, if their expectation is that they don’t want to move over the holidays, then share the reality of the timelines and current market so they can see they have control over those things, which can help set them up for success.&nbsp;

**3\. Make a plan.** Set a plan in motion; whether they’re ready to start ASAP or not, today’s technology allows for face-to-face meetings. There’s no reason not to get together in some way to connect and share the whole process with them. They’re thinking about making a move, so if you wait to meet, that allows for other influences or agents to get involved, and we don’t want that. Once you’re together, give them some homework and clarity on what they need to focus on while sharing all the things you’ll be doing for them.&nbsp;

If you have questions about these steps or any other real estate matter, call or email me. I would love to help you.
