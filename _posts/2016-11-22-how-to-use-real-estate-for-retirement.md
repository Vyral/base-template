If you are an investor, feel comfortable in real estate, and want to diversify your retirement portfolio, I recommend setting up a self-directed IRA.

 If you don’t like that your 401K or other IRA dollars are subject to the stock market, the self-directed IRA gives you more control by allowing you to use those funds to purchase real estate.

 What kinds of real estate can you purchase? You can purchase raw land, an apartment building, condos, a rental single-family home, and more.

Of course, there are a few rules. I won’t go into all of them today, but here are a few you should be aware of:

You cannot live in the property yourself. 
There may be some issues if you manage the property yourself.
You cannot collect the rents and use them for your personal funds; they have to stay in the account.

Since real estate is something that I understand, I would much rather invest in that than the stock market. The self-directed IRA gives you more control and is a great way to diversify your retirement portfolio.

 If you have any other questions about a self-directed IRA or you're interested in investing in real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help!
