Our agents at Carolina Real Estate Experts know the key to closing 40, 50, or more sales per year. The secret is all about your numbers.

If you’re a real estate agent looking for work in our area, as part of Carolina Real Estate Experts, I want to share with you just a few things that set our team apart.

**Agents on our team are held accountable for their numbers—they sell 40, 50, or more homes a year and consistently make six figures. **

So, if you are at a place in your real estate career where joining our team could be your next step, one major thing you need to do is to start tracking your numbers.

{% include pullquote.html %}

If keeping records of your work isn’t something you already do, now is the time to start. You can do this by quantifying your hours prospecting, the number of dials you made during that time, how many people you have contacted or, even better, made meaningful contact with, and also how many appointments you’ve had versus offers written under contract.

For an example of this, I looked to the first quarter numbers for one of our first full year agents. In January, they had six written offers, five in February, seven in both March and April, as well as 10 in May. And, as of the end of May, 21 of those homes have been closed on.

With numbers like this from the first five months of the year alone, it’s clear that this agent will make over 50 sales by the end of this year.

Tracking on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis will allow you to find trends in your numbers and use them to hit 40 to 50 sales per year.

If you, too, would like to have this kind of success and are thinking of joining our team, feel free to reach out to us by email, phone, or through our blog.  We look forward to hearing from you!
