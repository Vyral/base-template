Today I’m going to talk about why it’s important to get a preliminary title report when you’re selling a home in Utah. This issue doesn’t come into play extremely often, but when it does, it can be disastrous for your home sale.

**Hiring a title company to find out whether there are any liens or judgements on your property is critical** because a buyer will not come anywhere near your home if it does. We’ve seen many home sellers find out that there were liens or judgements against their home, and they had no idea about them even while they had lived in the property for a number of years.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, please contact us. **We know a lot of good title professionals in the area who can make sure you have no outstanding liens on your home.** This is one way to clear the bumps in the road.

We look forward to hearing from you!
