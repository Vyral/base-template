Your smartphone can be a great ally to you whether you’re buying, selling, or simply owning a home. **We are excited to share with you a few of our favorite “home” apps** that will help you do everything from scheduling a plumber to remodeling your kitchen. Here are our favorites:


1. **Treu Group Real Estate.** This is our very own free app in the app store. It has all of the local companies that we know and trust. Whether you need a good local contractor, or want a restaurant or doctor's recommendation. We even have some of the various charities we support on there.

2. **Handy.** Handy is an app where you can get a handyman or home cleaner to come over and do necessary work on your home. We have also given you a referral code so you can save on your first cleaning.

3. **Pinterest.** This app isn’t just popular for brides to be and home chefs, it can also be used to update your home. There are so many great home improvement ideas on the site. In fact, we recently did an update in our kitchen and the idea came directly from Pinterest.

4. **iHandy level free.** Who has a level anymore? Well, if you have a smartphone, you don’t need one. This app works great for hanging art or pictures up on the wall.

5. **Encircle.** This app will allow you to document and store information about all of your valuables in case of a future insurance claim.

6. **Houzz interior design ideas.** If you’re looking for ways to spruce up your home, this app has plenty of them.

7. **iScape free landscape designs.** If you’re going to be doing some outdoor landscaping, before you go out and make it happen you can use this app to see what the before and after will look like. You’ll be able to get an idea of how things will look without making a commitment.
