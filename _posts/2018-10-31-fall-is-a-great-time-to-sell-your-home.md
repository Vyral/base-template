A common question I hear around this time of year is, **“Should I sell in the fall?”** Many homeowners looking to sell are thinking about factors such as the new school year, the upcoming winter, and other reasons that may make it a bad time to list. With all this in mind, is it actually a good time to sell? **The quick answer is: yes!**

Jacksonville is a destination market for many throughout the country, so it’s typically always a good time to sell here. The seasonal influence on our market is hyperlocal and mainly comes from people escaping snowy weather or military relocation.

**There are three reasons to sell now:**

**1. There is little competition.** People who weren’t serious about selling have removed their homes from our market.

**2. Buyers are more serious.** Our inventory is lower but buyers are motivated, especially with the holidays on the horizon; they want to relocate quickly. People in the summer have more to choose from and don’t have the same sense of urgency.

**3. Interest rates will rise.** It’s a good idea to act now before rates go up even more. We’re getting news that they’ll be rising again, and buyers want to get a home before the increases hit.

Buyers are coming here with a purpose and a deadline, so now is the time to contact us if you’re looking to sell your home. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
