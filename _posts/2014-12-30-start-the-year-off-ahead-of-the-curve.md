{% include youtube.html %}Are you looking to list your home in the spring? If so, we need to talk now! I have said it before and will say it again, this time of year can actually be a GREAT time to sell if it works with your timeline. However, for those of you who absolutely need to wait until this next spring, NOW is the time to start talking with our team!Why?Northern Virginia Real Estate Agent

* Upgrades/Projects:  Our team can guide you through possible upgrades, renovations, or repairs that you may need to make now. Making the right changes now can ensure you get the biggest bang for your buck. Also, many contractors are thirsty for work this time of year and they are more willing to negotiate on bids. Did I mention they are typically easier to book out on your calendar? Win-Win!

* Understanding your financial position:  We will go through the numbers with you to see if it makes sense to sell now vs. the spring OR even at all. No matter your financial situation it is better for you to not lose ground when you’re thinking about listing your home. Let’s have those conversations now.

* Buyers start looking Jan. 1st:  Sellers beware! Contrary to popular belief, the weather outside does not deter serious buyers from looking. Buyers DO start calling our office to set up searches and get prepared for the spring market, if you have not started having conversations with us you’re behind the ball. One big reason – If you get into the market earlier we advertise your listing as a “pocket” or “coming soon” listing notifying other agents that hey, you’re looking for a buyer in the next 3 months.

Here at the Gresh Group, we value information and service which is why we provide a wealth of information to our clients.
