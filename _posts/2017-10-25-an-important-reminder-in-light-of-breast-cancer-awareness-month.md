Today’s message regarding Breast Cancer Awareness Month is for all you ladies out there who, like me, don’t schedule annual mammograms. I would encourage you to change that habit starting now.

Recently, I went in for my first mammogram ever. I hadn’t done any previously because, among other reasons, cancer doesn’t run in my family. By my own logic, I thought I didn’t need one. But I was wrong. Cancer was detected, but we’re in the process of getting that knocked out right now.

So, **whether you’re in the habit or not, get your mammogram scheduled.** If there is a problem, you can get it out of the way as fast as possible.
