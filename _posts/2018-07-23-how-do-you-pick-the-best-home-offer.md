If you’re a seller in Tucson, you should know that our market is very hot right now.

I’m sure those who keep up with the market trends know that by now, and also that it’s not uncommon to receive multiple offers on a property.

Today, I’d like to point out the fact that the highest offer isn’t necessarily the best offer. Price is only one of the many variables of a purchase contract.

{% include pullquote.html %}

A cash offer may be for less than a mortgaged offer, and a mortgaged offer might be more desirable to some sellers. A cash buyer has fewer contingencies, therefore, fewer outs to the contract.

My suggestion to sellers is to rely on your licensed, professional real estate agent to help you sort out which of those contracts is the one that should accept.

If you have any questions or are in need of professional help to guide you through your next transaction, please reach out to me. I’d be glad to assist you.
