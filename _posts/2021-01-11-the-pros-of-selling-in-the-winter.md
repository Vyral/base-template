<p style="text-align: center;"><em>January and February are great months to put your home on the market.</em></p>

If you need to sell your home in January or February, we have good news: **Now is a great time to put your home on the market, and there are several reasons why.&nbsp;**

For one thing, inventory is low. It’s been low for a couple of years, but it’s really low at the moment. Interest rates are also extremely low, which means there’s a pent-up demand from buyers that’s still carrying over from 2020. Many of them who perhaps lost a bidding war for the home they wanted or decided to wait to buy are ready to buy now. Additionally, now’s a great time to focus on the interior aspects of your home, which is what a lot of buyers are focusing on.&nbsp;

Speaking of which, **if you’re thinking of listing in the spring, there are several things you can do to your home to make it look fresh and show-ready.** First, take a walk around the house with a discerning eye. Let’s use the woodwork as an example. If you walk around your house and see any trim, solid wood doors, or cabinetry that looks dry or faded, moisturize and stain that area so it looks new again. After that, spackle over any nicks or holes in the walls. If you have to repaint, it’s always a good idea to use the same color for an entire floor. It might not look how you want it to look, but it helps the home look bright and open for showing purposes.&nbsp;

Another thing to consider is taking a look at the hardware. Is there any outdated brass from the 80s or 90s? If so, give it a facelift. Hardware is the jewelry of your home, so **giving it a fresh look is a simple and inexpensive way to make your home look better.&nbsp;**

Lastly, turn your attention to the home’s lighting. If, for example, you have a dinette light that’s visible from the foyer or other areas of the house, replace any dated fixtures and turn it into a fun, statement light since that’s a key focal point.&nbsp;
