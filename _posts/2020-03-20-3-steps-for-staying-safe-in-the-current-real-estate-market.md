<center><em>It&rsquo;s more important than ever to stay safe if you&rsquo;re in the process of buying or selling a home. Here&rsquo;s what you can do to stay healthy.</em></center>

<br>In this time of heightened awareness and social distancing, here are a few tips to help keep you safe if you’re buying or selling a home:

**1\. Always keep additional hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes handy**. Put them on the kitchen tables and in the bathrooms if you’re having a showing or open house. If you’re a buyer, use that sanitizer before and after you view homes.

**2\. If you’re not feeling well, don’t go out**. Stay home and have your agent go in your place. We can conference you in via video chat to still see the home. If you’re selling and you or someone in your home is sick, put off the showing. They’ll understand and appreciate the fact that you’re taking precautions.

**3\. Leave your kids at home**. Kids tend to wander and touch more things, and many carriers of the coronavirus are asymptomatic.
