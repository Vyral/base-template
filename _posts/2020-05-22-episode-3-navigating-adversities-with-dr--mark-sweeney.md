Business is not as usual as it was since the shutdown was imposed. Whether you’re brewing a new idea or trying to save a dwindling business model, there’s no doubt that everyone is being pushed to adapt and evolve to the changing economy. On this week's episode of Level Up With Rosie Hayer, Dr. Mark Sweeney of Austin Dental Spa joins us in an interesting conversation about the lessons that business owners can take away from navigating this crisis.

#### Draw the line

In this case, literally. Dr. Sweeney imparts practical advice of taking a horizontal line test when trying to assess a difficult situation. Draw an imaginary line, identify the two sides of the circumstance, and determine in which side of the line you are positioned. Looking at things this way makes you a wise thinker, helps you be in control, encourages you to let go of the uncontrollable, and allows you to rethink your purpose as an enterprise. By understanding your positioning, you equip yourself to adjust to disruptions and find ways to add value to your customers.

#### Build trust and relationships

Especially in a time where fear is at its peak, it’s important to serve as the crutch of the people you serve. When providing any kind of service, you must not detach yourself from your customer’s experience. Instead, you must immerse yourself in the commitment they make when they build connections with or through your business. For Dr. Sweeney, it’s the fusion of empathy and expertise that puts the quality of your service to a deeper level.&nbsp;

#### Resolve problems holistically

For someone who has practiced and mastered dentistry for decades, Dr. Sweeney contemplates on the power of taking preventative measures. Here, the conversation revolved around the importance of providing holistic solutions through your business. This means solving the problem at hand and going beyond that by educating people even before they experience the challenge. By being in touch with your customers’ needs, you give yourself a massive space to grow your vision and expand your venture even when a global disruption intervenes.

#### Simplify the system

One of the most powerful lessons that the crisis taught us is simplifying life as we know it. Nevertheless, this slowdown did not mean a step backward. The sudden turn of events motivated businesses to improvise methods that will work with the new norm, check old habits that might have been causing a negative impact on their growth, and correct outdated approaches to satisfying customers. As we brave our way out of the crisis, we are challenged to leave our pre-pandemic outlooks behind and bring new methods that will boost our growth as we move onwards.

In retrospect, we were indeed caught in a cycle. For a long time, life was all about winning deals, earning from investments, and expanding ventures. If there’s one important thing that the pandemic taught us, it is the value of reconnecting with our sense of being and extending this personal connection to others.&nbsp;
