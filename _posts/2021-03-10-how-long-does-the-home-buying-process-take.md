<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How long does it take to close on a home? It depends on your financing.</em></p>

How long does the home-buying process take? I receive this question all the time, so today I’m sharing the answer with all of you. **Generally, it can take anywhere between 30 to 45 days to complete the process** of closing on a home if you’re getting a loan but only about 14 days if you’re paying with cash. 

With a cash buyer, no other paperwork or approval is needed after the title commitment is completed. If you’re buying with a loan, after the option period, generally the appraisal is being ordered along with the title commitment, then it has to go through underwriting, so it all takes more time. **This also depends on what type of loan you’re getting.** For example, if you’re using a VA loan, the appraiser gets 10 business days to do the appraisal.
