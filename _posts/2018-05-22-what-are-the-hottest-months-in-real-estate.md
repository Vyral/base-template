Which months are the hottest in terms of real estate activity?

According to the Central Pennsylvania Multi-List (CPMLS), **April, May, and June are the three months when the most homes go under contract.** This time period is also when we have an increase in property inquiries, overall showings, and total contracts written.

Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, depending on the market and how interest rates are from year to year, but typically after the school year ends and we get past June, we go into a slowdown. I often call this the “mid-summer lull.” A lot of people are in vacation mode during this time—if they wanted to get into a new school district for their kids, they would’ve made an offer on a home already and settled in during June or July.

**After school starts and before the holidays, we experience an uptick in activity.** The fall season typically isn’t as active as the spring season, but it’s more active than the middle of the summer. Then, of course, we see another slowdown during the holidays and the winter months of January and February.

So, the hottest market typically happens during the spring, followed by the fall market, the summer market, and the winter market.

We’re still in the spring market right now, so if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home or you’d like a free home valuation, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
