Today we’re bringing you another great testimonial from agent Kaelee Miller. Here’s what she had to say about choosing Keller Williams, what makes her stand out as a real estate agent, and how KW has helped her throughout her career.

**Why did you choose KW?**

Last year, I decided what my goals were going to be. I knew what I wanted them to be, but I didn’t know how to get there. The team leader here at the Legacy office was super amazing—she always wanted to be there regardless of me being at KW or not. She would consistently reach out to me to see if she could help me. We met one night, and everything that KQ had to offer helped me get to the next level in my business and double the production I wanted to. They have training, they have statistics—they actually teach you how to run your business like a business, where before I didn’t realize it was a business. It was kind of a hobby at that time. Last year when I set out my goals I really wanted to step it up and have it more serious. When I met with the team leader, she actually had the statistics and the training that would help me, and they taught me to run it like a business.

**What makes you stand out as a real estate agent?**

I like to hold your hand when needed. If you’re a first-time homebuyer, I like to set aside the time to educate you through the process so it’s not just, “Oh hey, I’m buying a house.” You know the steps of the process. Another one is I like to set it up so I’m building a relationship with you through the process so when we close on the transaction, it’s not a transaction—I’m actually helping you get into the home and I build the relationship with you moving forward. I believe that helps me with building a referral-based business and having me be your lifetime Realtor, as you are my lifetime client.

**How has KW helped through the fears that come with being an agent?**

From experience, I did the assisting and helped on the back end, and then when I jumped in full time, that’s where I really excelled. I think KW really helps with holding your hand through that and they show you the process and the steps. They also include you in the KW statistics so that when you introduce yourself, you don't have to say, "Hi, I'm a new agent--I haven't closed a deal." You can actually say, "My brokerage," "Who I am with," or "We" when discussing your statistics. You get to use those different words where you have them behind you. The other thing I absolutely love about this office specifically but also KW overall is that every single person, regardless of how high-level they are or how busy they might seem, is there to help you. You can go knock on their door. You can go ask questions. I’ve been doing this for several years now, and I still have questions, and it’s super nice to just go knock on the door and be able to have them help me with whatever the question is, as silly as it is or if it’s a more in-depth question. There are always people here to help us.

Thanks to Joe for spending some time with us. If you have any questions for us in the meantime about KW or what it’s like to work here, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
