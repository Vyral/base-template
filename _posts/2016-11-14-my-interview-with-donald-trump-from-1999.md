As you may know, before I became a Realtor at RE/MAX Properties East in Louisville, I was a news anchor and reporter for TV stations around the country.

This job occasionally provided me with some interesting on-air opportunities, and I’d like to share one instance of this with you today.

Back in 1999 while covering the Kentucky Derby, I got to interview Donald Trump. His date to the Derby is someone you will probably recognize!

In the interview, Trump says that he was visiting the “beautiful” Churchill Downs because a friend of his had a horse racing in the Kentucky Derby. When I asked whether he’d be interested in investing in horse racing, he responded that he didn’t think so because it would be “A very full-time kind of a thing.”

I don’t clearly remember all of the details of the interview at the time, looking back, the obvious question I wish I would have asked him was, “Would you ever consider running for president?”
