Today, we will get to know our transaction coordinator, Karen Agar, better. She will share how she started in real estate, what her experience has been like as a member of our team, and what she loves about her work now.

**Karen embarked on her real estate journey in 2009 when she joined a construction company in an administrative role.** She guided customers through the homebuilding process until 2018 when, sadly, the company closed its doors. This left Karen at a crossroads, without a job and uncertain about her next steps.

Amids this uncertainty, an agent reached out to Karen about a forthcoming real estate team. After some contemplation and the encouragement of a friend, she decided to pursue this opportunity. She took the necessary classes, obtained her real estate license, and joined the new team. However, the path didn't unfold as she had anticipated, and she found herself lacking the job satisfaction she desired.

Simultaneously, a friend introduced her to a position on the Dave Hook team, a group she had known since her new construction days. Recognizing the potential, she decided to seize this opportunity. Karen looks forward to putting her visions and goals into action, especially in a place that encourages discussing dreams and provides a clear path to achieving them.

**A significant factor for Karen in any career move is the ability to help people**. Now, she gets to fulfill this passion daily in her role as a transaction coordinator, assisting people through their real estate transactions. Additionally, she contributes to the community through the team's non-profit work. Karen is grateful for her journey and thrilled about where it has led her so far.
