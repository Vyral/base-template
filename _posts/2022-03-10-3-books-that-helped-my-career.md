I’ve received a lot of great advice over the years, but what has stuck with me the most are the business and mindset books that put me in the right space to succeed. That’s why today I want to share three great books that will help your real estate journey in 2022:

**1\. “Atomic Habits” by James Clear.** This book dives deep into how habits are the basis of everything else we do. One of my favorite things about James is his weekly three-two-one newsletter, which is always full of exciting ideas. I see him as a big thought leader in business today, and this book is a great introduction to his ideas if you haven’t encountered them already.

**2\. “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blount.** I love this book because most agents overcomplicate prospecting. Jeb breaks down the prospecting mindset and shares some great exercises to get more out of your hours.

**3\. “How To Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie.** This one is old school. It may have been written in the 1930s, but it’s a great resource if you want to understand how to connect with people. It also has a more formal style than we’re used to today, so it’s a nice change of pace.

If you have questions about today's topic or anything else, please call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you\!
