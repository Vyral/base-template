Are you looking to build up your database? I recently got a great idea of how to do just that from my friend, business coach, and trainer: Brian Eisenhower.

As a team, he taught us **a fun trick and tool to build your database by simply using Facebook.** More than likely, you’re already on there, so why not make it purposeful?

Get on your smartphone and go into your Facebook mobile app. From there, go to your profile page and you’ll find your friends list in ascending order. Eventually, **you’ll create a private message to send out to your friends list, but remember Facebook’s regulations—you’ll get into trouble if you send a message to too many people.** The way around this barrier is to send your message out to 20 people a day, just to avoid “Facebook jail.”

As far as what this message contains, make it generic since you’ll be copying and pasting it. Here’s the script that I use:

{% include pullquote.html %}

“Hey, it’s Jenny. How have you been? I’m updating my real estate database and I’d like to send real estate info from time to time. My real estate business was amazing last year.” Or, as an alternative to that line, “I’m new to real estate and I need to be better about staying in touch with people I know. Would you mind replying with your home address, phone number, and email to help me out?”

Keep your message short and sweet. It’s amazing; **people actually respond,** and these are your Facebook friends, so it’s likely that they know you and want to support you.

Use this tip to build your database. I’ve found that even though you might be an agent who’s been in business for a while, **you might be missing out if you’re not utilizing Facebook to expand your reach.**

If you have any questions or thoughts about this approach, please reach out to me. If you give it a try, I’d love to hear your results as well!
