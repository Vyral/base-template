Today I’m going to give you a market update of where we’ve been in 2017 and where we’re headed in 2018. As we all know, the real estate market and the financial market have been doing very well over the past 12 months. **The numbers continue to back this up.**

**In Bucks County alone, we’ve seen a 5% increase in median home prices** in the last year. When it comes to inventory, we’ve seen a 15% drop in the past year. This is what’s driving prices up. More homes sold and less homes on the market equals rising prices.

In Montgomery County, we’ve also seen about a 4.5% median increase in sale prices over the past year. **If you’d like to get any more specific market data on your neighthood, your township, or your school district, we’d be happy to provide you with those.** Just give us a call or send us an email.

A lot of people also ask me around this time of year if it’s a good idea to sell their home. Right now, I’d say yes. There are not many homes on the market right now, but low interest rates are still driving buyers in the market. I think December is going to be a great month for us in the end. If you’re thinking about moving, getting your home on the market now will allow you to beat the rush of sellers that will list when the spring hits.

If you have any other questions for me or need any real estate advice, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
