Open houses can either go really well or really badly, but in either case, they’ll still generate a lot of foot traffic. How do you plan an open house so that you gain leads from it, though? There are a few important tips to remember.&nbsp;

First, **focus on having the right mindset.** Believe that the connections you make at your open house will translate to either a sale or a new lead. After all, when you host an open house, you’re there for two reasons—to sell the house and gain leads.&nbsp;

Beyond having the right mindset, you also need to set out a lot of signage. Our team sets out as many as 15 signs for our open houses. The more signage you have, the more traffic you’ll generate. Putting out a lot of signs can be time-consuming, but it’s worth it in the end.&nbsp;

Door knocking is another way to generate interest. Even though the people you meet may not attend the open house, it’s still a great way to make connections, and they can make a great addition to your database.&nbsp;

Now that you know what to do to prepare for your open house, what should you do the day of?

First, **make sure you arrive 15 to 30 minutes early.** There’s nothing worse than walking up to an open house only to find someone already waiting for you in the driveway.&nbsp;

Next, have a sign-in sheet ready for everyone who attends. You can use anything from an iPad to a pen and paper—just make sure you get the contact information of the attendees. This includes their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. They should also provide the name of their agent. However, people who aren’t willing to sign the sign-in sheet shouldn’t be allowed to view the home.&nbsp;

The goal of an open house is to connect with people on an emotional level, so **don’t be overbearing toward people as they view the home.** They should feel at ease and totally relaxed—you’re not there to sell them on “you.” And if a neighbor comes over, make sure that you welcome them as you would anyone else.&nbsp;

Also, don’t forget to have some fun! People will pick up on the vibe you put out. Do this because you want to, not because you have to.&nbsp;

After the open house is over, it’s a good idea to take notes about the connections you made. Again, don’t forget to add these people into your database. Keep in mind as well that your ultimate goal is to sell the home, itself. If anyone attends with their agent in tow, be sure to let the listing agent know, because this is a great opportunity to get some feedback about the house.&nbsp;

To summarize, open houses are a great way to get clients, so keep your energy up and be yourself.&nbsp;
