Today I’m with a sponsor for the [Mansfield Shootout](http://www.mansfieldshootout.com/), Dr. Bobbit with [Mansfield Chiropractic](https://mansfieldchiropractic.com/). Dr. Bobbit loves to help out the community, and he is eager to help us, as all of our donations will go to Habitat for Humanity to help build homes for those in need.

Dr. Bobbit’s desire to help people has guided him throughout his life, and that’s why he now owns his own chiropractic clinic. He is dedicated to helping people through a natural process. One of his recent innovations has to do with spinal decompression, but he also offers massages, chiropractic work, and nutritional advice.

Last but not least, we are still looking for sponsors for our event. For just $100 we will put your business’ sign on one of eight shooting greens. It’s a great way to get your business seen.

Also, if you’ve never shot a gun, this tournament is a great place to start. The event will be taking place on June 18th at the Alpine Shooting Range at 5482 Shelby Rd. in Fort Worth. It’s $100 for one shooter or $385 for four. All proceeds are going to benefit the Trinity Habitat for Humanity.
