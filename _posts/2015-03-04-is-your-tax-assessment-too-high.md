Spring is right around the corner, and you know what that means: Tax Season. If you haven't gotten it already, the county will be sending out a property tax assessment for the property you own. They will tell you how much they think the property is worth, so they can tax you accordingly.

Is this the same thing as an appraisal? No. An appraisal is done by the bank, and is a detailed single property valuation. Assessments are based on large numbers of sales that are analyzed to determine values for large groups of similar properties. With an appraisal, you want to get the highest figure possible to increase the sale price of your home.

For a property tax assessment, you want the number to be as low as possible, so you don't have to pay as much in taxes. The reality is that these assessments could be inaccurate, and you might be getting taxed more than you should be.

If you think your property tax assessment is wrong, whether it's too high or too low, give us a call. We can help you go through your options, which can include filing an appeal against the county's assessment. Any appeal has to be done in a timely manner.  We look forward to hearing from you soon!
