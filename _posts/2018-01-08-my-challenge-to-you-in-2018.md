A new year is a great opportunity for a fresh start, but you have to be willing to work for it.

2018 is upon us and I hope you’re having a fantastic year so far.

That being said, January is a time of change. People tend to set goals for themselves when this month rolls around only to abandon them in February. Why does this happen?

Something I want you to think about this year is the “Wheel of Life.” The Wheel of Life is basically comprised of every aspect of your life, including your finances, your health, your career, and more.

Think about this: **If you had to rate each aspect of your life on a scale from one to 10, how well would those ratings turn out?** Ideally, every aspect of your life should be well-balanced around this wheel.

But real life isn’t so simple. Change is not easy, nor is it comfortable. That’s exactly why successful people get comfortable being uncomfortable.

The pain of changing must be less of the pain of staying stuck in something negative. It really comes down to asking yourself what you’re willing to accept in life. **In 2018, I challenge you to raise your standards.**

When you decide what you want and expect out of life, you have the power to take control. One way to help yourself take control is by surrounding yourself with people who build you up instead of those who tear you down.

What gets me out of bed every day is making a difference in people’s lives.

If there’s anything I can help you with, real estate or otherwise, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
