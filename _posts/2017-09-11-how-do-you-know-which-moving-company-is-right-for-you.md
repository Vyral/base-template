If you’ve sold your house, how can you have a stress-free move and be prepared on the day of the actual settlement? There are a few things you need to remember.

First, you have to find the right moving company. When looking for a moving company, you want to make sure you protect yourself. You can follow one of your Realtor’s recommendations, but you also want to get more than one bid.

When accepting bids, **beware of any lowball offers.** If a company tells you they can move your things for a lot less than the competition, it will usually end up costing you more if you hire them.

Also, make sure the company you’re considering hiring is licensed and insured. Go online and check for reviews of their service and see if there are any complaints against them.

Once the movers are set in place, **have a contingency plan in place.** What happens that day if the truck doesn’t show up? If—for whatever reason—the movers can’t move that day, what will you do?

If you follow these tips, your move should go smoothly. If you have any questions about finding the right moving company or the moving process in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help.
