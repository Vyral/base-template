We are oftentimes asked by people who are considering making a move, “When is the best time to sell your home?”

Most real estate agents would say that the best time to sell is springtime. However, do the facts actually support this view?

Looking at the median sales price charts for LA and Orange County over the past six years, **we can say that’s pretty true.** Generally speaking, the highest median sales prices occur from February through June, and the highest volume of homes being sold occurs in the May, June, and July range. Spring and summer are the hottest months of the year.

In order to close your transaction in those times, **you need to have had your home on the market in the preceding month or two****,** so as to give buyers time to see your home and to close escrow.

However, while the market might be the hottest right now, **it also depends on your own personal factors,** as well. Are you going through a job relocation? Are you getting married or having a baby soon? Are the kids about to start school? You need to consider all these things when it comes to timing a home sale.

Recent real estate trends also play a role—the specifics of your home as well as the homebuyers that you’ll likely attract. For example, while there are fewer buyers in the fall and winter, they tend to be a little more serious about getting their transactions done before the holidays. It’s not as simple as saying that spring and summer are the best times to sell your home.
