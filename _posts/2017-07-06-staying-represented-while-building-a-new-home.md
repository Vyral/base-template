Inventory has been shrinking recently and a lot of buyers are turning to building new homes instead.

When buyers do this, though, they need to ensure they are being well-represented.&nbsp;

Today, we’d like to share three reasons why that is.&nbsp;

First of all, when a buyer enters a model home the agent they are greeted by is actually representing the builder. This agent is focused on the builder’s money and best interest as opposed to the buyer’s. &nbsp;

While they are usually very friendly and don’t mean ill will toward the buyer, it is important to be represented nonetheless.&nbsp;

Next, buyers should remember that **many builders use their own purchase agreement**. We’ve personally seen these contracts and know that they can be upwards of 30 to 40 pages long.&nbsp;

So having someone who is representing you available to read and interpret these kinds of documents will be very important to the process and your understanding of it.

Finally, **the purchase of a home is an emotional decision**. All else aside, a home is somewhere you are going to put down roots, make memories, and spend time with your family. It can be hard to separate yourself from this emotion so having someone who will be able to help you do so is greatly helpful.&nbsp;

Ultimately it’s nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process and can help you make the many decisions associated with homeownership.
