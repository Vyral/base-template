*Now that we’re halfway through the year, it’s time for a market update.*

Today, I’m out at the Play Shop, where I’ve just found some real estate statistics for our Austin, Texas area for the month of June.

Here in Austin, the median home price has gone up 4% year over year from last June. The price that homes are selling for, on average, is now $303,000.

Remember to think of this number as a halfway point — **half of homes will sell above this price, and half will sell below.**

In fact, we’re seeing a few numbers that have gone up from this time last year.

Today, our average days on market is 16 days—meaning that number is up 14% from what we saw this time last year.

Total sales, though, are down 3% from last year—$3,656 for the month of June. But, the **average price per square foot is currently $182, and some new builders are doing even better than that.**

If you have any other questions or want more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
