Today we'll talk about why it’s impossible to time the market.

**Simply put, we can't predict the future.** We don't know what the interest rates will be, and we don't know what our inventory supply will be by the end of the year. We also don't know what kind of loan programs will still be out there.

**On appointments, I often hear people say that they’ll wait until spring.** What if interest rates have jumped so much by spring that buyers have lost purchase power that our market shifts? Trying to time the market can end up coming back to bite you. If you can act now, then you should. If not, deal with the market where it is later and do it then.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
