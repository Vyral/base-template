As a homebuyer, you always want to work with your own agent rather than just talking to the listing agent at the home you want to buy. Here’s why.

If you’re buying a home here in the Wilmington area, how can you be sure you get the best terms and price?

**The first thing you want to do is hire an agent to represent you rather than talking directly to the listing agent for the home you want to buy.** As Realtors, we’re bound by ethical guidelines to represent our client, so the listing agent works for the home’s seller to get them their best terms and price.

As a homebuyer, you should talk with a buyer specialist to get the best terms and price for the home. That buyer specialist represents you and has an ethical responsibility to get you the best terms and price to make sure you’re not overpaying or buying a home with a lot of problems. For that reason, I also always recommend getting a home inspection and an appraisal.

When you walk through the home, you want to make sure you’re not spending a lot of money up front. **We want to take the time to go through the home and analyze it from our perspective to make sure it’s in good shape.**

Also, know that if you receive property updates and new listing alerts from a real estate website, you might not be getting access to all the homes currently on the market. One of the great ways to get a better deal on a house is to beat other buyers to new listings. We have a buyer’s advantage program that gives you instant access and priority to homes as soon as they hit the market.

If you’d like to know more about this program or any more information about buying or selling a home in the Wilmington area, give me a call or send me an email anytime. I’d be more than happy to help you.
