Today’s topic begins my new series about developing a strong client relationship within your first year in the business.

The first thing you need to realize about real estate is that it is a people business. It goes all the way back to what Zig Ziglar used to say, **“People don’t care how much you know until they know about how much you care.”**

You also need to know that there’s a difference between listening and waiting to talk. There are so many people in the real estate industry who don’t listen to the clients. They’re waiting for the client to stop talking so that they can talk and impress them with what they know.

The thing is that people don’t care about that until they know that you actually care about them, their needs, wants, and desires.

I would tell any real estate agent just beginning their career to **slow down, listen, and care about what the clients are saying,** and that if you make an investment in people, it always returns dividends.

If you have any questions about this or other real estate-related subjects, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.
