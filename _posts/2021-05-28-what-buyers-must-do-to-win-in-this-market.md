Right now, the real estate market is crazy, especially for buyers. Inventory is very low, meaning there are very few options to choose from, and most homes have multiple offers on them, making them very competitive to purchase.

If you’re looking to buy a home and want to be successful, there are two things you absolutely must do:

**1\. Get pre-approved.** With the pandemic, the rule is that you must be pre-approved to be able to view houses in person, and only two people plus an agent will be allowed on the property.

**2\. Be aggressive.** You can’t afford to wait around debating whether or not to make a move on a home. By the time most houses hit the market, they have multiple offers on them, and they’re usually pending within 48 to 72 hours, so you need to act fast and aggressively if you want a shot at getting the home.&nbsp;

Also, keep in mind that buyers aren’t getting their closing costs paid; in the past, sellers have been willing to pay buyers’ closing costs, but in this market, you need to have enough money to pay them yourself. Similarly, where sellers once covered the costs of the appraisal, buyers are now having to carry the costs themselves.
