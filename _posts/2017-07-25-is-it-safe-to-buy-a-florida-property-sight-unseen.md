Buying a property sight unseen can be a little scary, but it’s becoming more common in our market.&nbsp;

Back in 2016, only one in five people bought properties without walking through them. Now, one in three people in our market are buying a property sight unseen. In our high-end market, **40% of buyers are comfortable with buying a home without seeing it in person**.&nbsp;

Homebuyers say that new technology such as high-definition photos, virtual tours, and FaceTime calls with their Realtors help them feel like they’re in the home already, so it’s fairly risk-free.&nbsp;

We do have a lot of people who go ahead and make a bid, buy the property, and close without ever seeing the home.&nbsp;

However, it’s more common for someone to go through a virtual tour before making an offer to the seller. Once the seller accepts your bid, you’ve got 15 days to get down here and look at the house during your due diligence period. Then, if you want to walk away from the property, the worst-case scenario is that you got to spend a long weekend with us here in Florida.&nbsp;

**Of course, it takes a confident buyer and a trusted real estate agent to make this possible**. If you live out of state and you are buying a Florida home, you need to have a strong, confident Realtor to help you close on that property.&nbsp;

The market is moving very quickly, so if you have any other questions about buying a Florida home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
