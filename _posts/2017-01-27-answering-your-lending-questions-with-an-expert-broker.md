Today I’m joined by Jim Evans, a mortgage broker with Potomac Trust Mortgage, to answer a few questions you may have about the world of lending.

**How will changing interest rates affect your purchasing power in 2017?**Rates went up almost a full percentage point in the weeks after the election, but they’ve settled back down since then. They’re currently about 0.625% higher than they were prior to the election. As far as purchasing power goes, that’s a loss of around $32,000 on a $400,000 home. Most experts and bond traders predict rates to continue to increase this year, which means if you’re thinking about buying a home, now is the time to do it.

What’s the difference between working with a mortgage broker and working with a bank? Unlike banks, mortgage brokers can offer you a variety of different rates. They also have very little overhead, and they pass those savings onto their customers. The rates at Potomac Trust Mortgage, for example, are in the top 5% for government loans, especially under $636,000.

**Do you really need 20% down to buy a home?** No. For conventional loans, you can go as low as 3% down, depending on your income. It will usually be closer to 5% down, though, and you’ll have to pay mortgage insurance on it. Mortgage insurance protects the lender instead of the borrower, but it’s mandatory if you pay less than 20%. You can also do an FHA loan, which is 3.5% down. If you’re a veteran, you can do a VA loan and put no money down.

Jim has been in the business for over 20 years, and his reputation and expertise are unsurpassed. If you want to get in touch in with him, you can call him at 703-435-4369 or email him at JE@potomactrustmortgage.com.

If you have any more questions, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!
