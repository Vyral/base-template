If you plan on selling your home, here are five updates that you should avoid making to it before you list it:

**1. Wallpaper.** You don’t want to add wallpaper unless it’s a custom home or you’ve been asked by a custom designer to add wallpaper.

**2. Lavish light fixtures.** Your light fixtures should be clean and simple. Buyers don’t like to overspend money, and most of them won’t see the value in lavish light fixtures.

**3. Replacing carpet with carpet.** In older homes and high-traffic areas like hallways and living rooms, we find a lot of carpeting. In this case, I recommend that you replace that carpet with a high-quality laminate floor, an engineered wood floor, or a hardwood floor. You can find a very good entry-level engineered wood floor at a similar price to carpet and it would only take a day or two to replace any area you desire in your home.

**4. Painting in bold colors.**Don’t go with and bold reds, greens, or blues. Keep your colors clean, neutral, and calm. Buyers will appreciate that.

**5. Overspending on the landscaping.** Usually, you won’t get a good return on your investment anyway when it comes to landscaping. Although you want to update the curb appeal for your home, you don’t want to overspend.
