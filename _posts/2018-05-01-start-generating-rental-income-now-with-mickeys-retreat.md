Our clients often tell us that they’re interested in purchasing a property for investment. So today we’re going to introduce you to a fantastic opportunity to purchase a short-term vacation rental property.

**If you’ve seen our earlier videos, you know that the No. 1 key to purchasing a short-term rental property or vacation home is location.** This means considering not only where it’s located in the city, but also whether the city it’s located in is short-term rental friendly or not.&nbsp;

Many of you have probably heard that the city of Anaheim does not permit short-term rentals. That’s partially true. No new short-term rental permits are being issued, but those with current licenses are allowed to operate. **Three things make this home a unique investment opportunity that you should consider:**

**1. It’s fully licensed and operating legally.** You can’t buy a new or existing residential home in Anaheim and get a short-term rental permit. The only way you can operate such a home is by purchasing one with an active license and permit.&nbsp;

**2. It’s fully furnished.** No need to purchase furniture, appliances, or other kitchen items. It’s furnished and rent-ready.

**3. It comes with existing reservations.** Imagine purchasing an investment with immediate cash flow! From the time you close escrow, you'll be generating income. This home books extremely well and the calendar is packed with reservations for the summer.

If you’ve been looking for that special deal on an investment property, don’t let this one pass you by. If you have any questions for us about this home or how it can help you generate instant income, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
