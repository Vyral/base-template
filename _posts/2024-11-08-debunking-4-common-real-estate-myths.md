Ever feel confused about finding the right real estate agent? There are many myths out there, and I’m here to set the record straight. Let’s break down these myths and make sure you know how to get the best help when buying or selling a home:

**Myth 1: All real estate agents are the same.** Many believe that every real estate agent offers the same service and expertise. This isn’t true. In reality, a small percentage of agents do most of the business in any market. Some agents handle only three or four deals a year. Others, like my team, work on many more and bring a higher level of skill and support. This difference matters. When you work with a team, you get a group of experts collaborating to ensure everything runs smoothly. The results? A big difference in how your transaction ends.

**Myth 2: You save money without an agent.** You might think you can save money by skipping an agent and listing your home yourself on sites like Zillow. It sounds simple, right? But here’s the reality: most people who do this make much less on their home sale. Why? Without an agent, you might not price your home right. You might not know how to prepare it for showings. And when offers come in, you’ll need strong negotiation skills. Mistakes can cost you—more than any commission. So, while you may avoid paying an agent, your final profit could be much lower.

**Myth 3: Agents will push you to spend more.** Some think agents want you to buy a home that’s over your budget. They think agents are just greedy. If that’s happening, you’re working with the wrong agent. A good agent respects your budget. They find homes that fit your needs, not just their paycheck. I’ve been in this business for over 25 years. I know that building trust and relationships lasts longer than any quick deal.

**Myth 4: All markets are the same.** Buying or selling a home three states away isn’t the same as doing it locally. Real estate markets are unique. What worked in one area may not work in another. Local agents know the ins and outs of their market. They understand trends, buyer interest, and local programs. This knowledge makes a huge difference in your outcome.
