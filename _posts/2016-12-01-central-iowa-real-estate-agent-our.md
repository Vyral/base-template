Our certified pre-owned home program allows our sellers to have their home pre-inspected before it hits the market and puts them in a position of power when it comes to negotiations.

One thing that really sets our team apart is that we offer our sellers different listing options when they go to sell their home. One of the most popular options that have been well-received by buyers is the certified pre-owned home program.

What exactly does that involve? **With a certified pre-owned home program, you have your home pre-inspected before you hit the market.** We sit down together, go through the inspection, and look at the targeted items that need to be addressed to make your home the most marketable and most appealing to get top dollar. Along with that inspection, we offer a home warranty through HWA for the first 13 months after the buyer has purchased.

This program has provided amazing peace of mind for our sellers. We find over and over again that one of the most stressful parts of the home selling process isn’t having your home on the market or obtaining that accepted offer; on the contrary, it’s actually all the stuff that happens afterward. This is because after you hit that inspection period, there’s really a second negotiation that occurs.

**We put you as a seller in a position of power instead of weakness when it comes to these negotiations.** We have you armed with information in order to eliminate all of these different questions.

As a buyer, it’s advantageous to know that you’re working with a seller who is diligent enough to take on this expense and all these different projects before they even put the home on the market. The seller, in effect, is presenting you with a move-in ready home.

We’re the only real estate company that offers this program, and we’re thrilled that it’s been so successful for our clients.
