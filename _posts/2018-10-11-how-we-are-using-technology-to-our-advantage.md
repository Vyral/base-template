We wanted to share an exciting announcement with you today. Keller Williams, the leading real estate company in the world, has recently announced that they are now operating as a technology company. **This is really exciting because of all the innovative technology that is available and is going to be available to us as agents and to you as clients.**

One of the features that is out right now is called the “Kelly” app. For my clients here in San Antonio, let’s say you’re moving to Houston and want to find a top agent in a specific neighborhood. **I can literally pick up my phone, ask “Kelly,” and get the answer immediately.** Then we can get you in contact with them.

As the No. 1 real estate company in the world, all of the data from our transactions is now all in one database. We are able to use that data to help you with buying or selling a home and even help predict market trends.

<br>**E******ven** though I have my own brokerage, I still choose to work with Keller Williams for the unparalleled opportunities they offer in many areas**, including technology. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
