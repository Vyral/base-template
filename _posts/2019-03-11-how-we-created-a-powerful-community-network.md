We’ve implemented something new in our business that will help us grow relationships with other business owners, bolster our database, and, best of all, have a lot of fun! You can do this exact same thing with your business and create a powerful network for yourself, your colleagues, and other business owners.

**We’ve created an event called BOSS—business owners sharing strategies.** The goal for us is to become the local professionals who create and enhance relationships among members of our community, especially in regard to like-minded business people.

We invited people we know—database members, vendors, partners, colleagues, and essentially all types of business owners—to a mastermind session. While attendees enjoyed food and drinks, we were able to go around the room and have everyone introduce themselves, say what they’re good at, and also share what they struggle with.&nbsp;

Everyone worked together and shared brilliant ideas, and a wonderful network united before us. **By implementing your own BOSS event, you’ll be able to add value, give back, meet people, and share and learn new ideas.**

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
