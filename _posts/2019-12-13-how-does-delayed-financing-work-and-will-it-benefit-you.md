*What is delayed financing and how can you benefit from it? Let’s discuss.*

Every now and then, I meet with a homeowner who chose to make an all-cash purchase on their home. While there’s nothing wrong with buying your home this way, if you ever want to accrue debt on the property, my opinion is **it’s best to start at the original point of purchase.** Today I’ll tell you why, but I’ll also explain an alternative option: **delayed financing**. &nbsp;

If, subsequent to your all-cash purchase, you go to a lender to take cash out of the property, your cash-out refinance rate will be a little higher than the original purchase-money rates. What’s more, the IRS will only give you a 90-day window to close on a cash-out refinance from your original purchase and reclassify the debt from equity indebtedness to acquisition indebtedness. The significance of which is **your mortgage interest can’t be written off on an equity indebtedness loan. &nbsp;&nbsp;**

This is a conversation worth having with your CPA, but I’ll give you the gist: If you ever want to have mortgage debt on your property, start by financing your home from the get-go. However, if you’ve already bought your home in cash, it’s not necessarily too late. **Your next best option is to do it immediately thereafter through a delayed financing mortgage**, so you have the ability to deduct your mortgage interest come tax time.&nbsp;

Now, I should point out that delayed financing loans can be tricky. For one thing, **lenders have to source the funds from the original cash purchase**—by far the most common issues that arises. In other words, the way we handle financing in a specific situation will depend on the source of the funds used to buy the home. For example, say the source was a secured asset like a brokerage line of credit or a home equity line of credit. In that case, the cash-out proceeds for the delayed financing loan must go directly to that particular creditor to pay back what was borrowed. &nbsp;

It’s also fairly common for us to see situations where a third-party person has gifted the money to the original purchaser. Unfortunately, this will disqualify you from receiving a delayed financing loan. Based on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae’s regulatory rules, it’ll be six months before you’re eligible for a cash-out refinance, which is, of course, problematic since you have just 90 days to receive the tax writeoff associated with acquisition indebtedness. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The bottom line is the way you structure financing on the front end correlates with your likelihood for success on the back end.&nbsp;
