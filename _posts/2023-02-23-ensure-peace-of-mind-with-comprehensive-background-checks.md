One of our top priorities is ensuring that our clients' properties are being rented to reliable tenants. One of the key ways we achieve this is by conducting thorough background checks on potential tenants.

So why are background checks so important? The answer is simple: when a property owner entrusts us with their property, they expect us to do everything in our power to ensure that their investment is protected. Conducting background checks is an essential part of that process.

**Our background checks cover a wide range of areas.** First, we ask applicants to provide their personal information, which we then use to conduct a comprehensive online search. We also verify their employment history by contacting their employer to verify the information provided on their application.

In addition, we require banking information from applicants so we can assess their financial stability and ensure that they have the means to pay their rent on time. We also conduct checks on the applicant's rental history by contacting their past landlords.

All of these checks are critical in helping us **make informed decisions about potential tenants.** By looking at an applicant's history, we can get a sense of their reliability, responsibility, and financial stability. This, in turn, helps us ensure that our clients' properties are being rented to trustworthy tenants who will take good care of the property and pay their rent on time.

Our background check process is an integral part of our guarantee program, which includes a rent guarantee, an eviction guarantee, and a communication guarantee. These guarantees ensure that our clients' properties are being managed to the highest standards and that they are protected in the event that something goes wrong.

If you have any questions about our background check process or our guarantee program, please don't hesitate to call or email us at (808) 445-9223.
