Which remodeling projects will bring you the most value?&nbsp;

People ask us all the time what will bring them the most return on investment. This is a great question, since the right updates can really boost value in a property.

First, &nbsp;we always recommend is starting with the kitchen. Spending some money on bringing your kitchen up to date could bring you an 85% return on investment.&nbsp;

So long as you’re careful not to spend more than 20% of your home’s value, kitchen remodeling is a great place to start when improving your home. In fact, **the kitchen is one of the first places people look at during home showings.**

Next, you need to consider your curb appeal. Pay close attention to the condition of your siding. Is the siding off-color or peeling? Fixing these little issues, potentially by replacing the siding altogether, can bring huge returns. This kind of update can actually bring an 85% return on investment.

Our third major area of focus is the bathrooms. Remodeling projects can actually be very therapeutic. Remodeling rooms like your kitchen or bathroom will definitely bring more money. Exceeding your home’s current value is easier than you think by making these key changes.

Some of these changes are fairly small. Sellers should consider replacing old our outdated windows. **A move-in ready home is always going to be more attractive to buyers.**

Finally, you may want to consider remodeling the deck. When people put money into their deck, this can bring great returns for the effort.&nbsp;
