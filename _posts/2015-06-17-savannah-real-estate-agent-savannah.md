Today, I want to give you a quick update on the Savannah market, so you can make informed real estate decisions this summer!

Conditions are great in our area right now; we're seeing a lot of activity and values are on the rise. The good news is that not only are home values increasing, but they're increasing at a sustainable rate.

We've been fortunate to see incredibly low interest rates for an extended period of time and they are still quite low. However, rates are beginning their upward climb and are likely to jump significantly over the next year or two, making now a great opportunity to lock in low monthly payments on a new home.

If you have any questions about the market in your neighborhood, or if you want to explore your options in real estate, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're always happy to talk with you, and encourage you to do so soon!
