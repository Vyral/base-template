Today I wanted to talk about the famous Zillow Zestimate. Are Zestimates accurate?

I get this question all the time from clients when I go to meet them and they tell me what the Zestimate is on their home. Unfortunately, a lot of people think that this value is accurate and represents a true value of their home. What I wanted to share today is what the Zestimate really is, how it works, and what your expectations should be about it.

A Zestimate is an automated valuation model (AVM), and it's a computer-generated algorithm that pulls in data to give an estimate on the value of your house. Typically, they're very inaccurate, and it's rare that a Zestimate is right.

When you're selling your home, pricing it properly and understanding the true market value are two of the most important things.

When it comes to Zestimates, more than 17% of homes sold in the market had a Zestimate that was more than 20% off! If you had a $500,000 house you're selling and the Zestimate is off by 20% or more, we're talking about a $100,000 inaccuracy. That's a huge difference in the true value of your home.

The funny thing is, Zillow's CEO sold his home this year for $1,050,000. The Zestimate on his home from his own company was $1,750,000 - more than 40% off from his sale price!

Even in Zillow's fine print, they say that if you want a true market value for your home, hire a professional. You can either hire an appraiser or a Realtor who is working with recent comps and doing a CMA for your property.
