<center><em>Each client event must have a different purpose to ensure interaction.</em></center>

<br>It’s time to spread some holiday cheer. You know we love sharing all the systems, tools, and models with you that we at the Wolek Group use, and today we want to tell you about a giveaway event we’re doing that might inspire you to do one of your own.

2020 has been an interesting year, to say the least, and it’s forced us to shift the way we host client events. Last year we were able to host an in-person Storytime With Santa event that was so much fun, and we look forward to marking it on our calendar for 2021. We obviously can’t do that this year, but we still wanted to have some fun with our database, and we came up with a giveaway that can be described as our take on the 12 Days of Christmas. We call it our Very Merry Giveaways. **Over seven days, we’re giving away multiple prize packages** at random to anyone who registers for the giveaway.

Every event you host must have a purpose. You have to know why you’re doing something. To be honest, we’ve done many giveaways this year with different purposes in mind, and this event’s purpose was to generate social media engagement on many channels (mainly Facebook and Instagram) and get new followers and likes for our pages. That’s how people can register, and they can do so up until the last day.

The day this video was recorded was the first day of the event, and **aside from giving away prizes, we plan to do everything we love:** Have fun with our database, engage and give back to our community, and promote local businesses. We reached out to all the local businesses we’ve done promotions with this year and asked them if they’d be willing to donate prizes, and wouldn’t you know it—they all said yes. For their participation, we can now promote these businesses even more, so it’s a win-win. To give back to the community, we pledged to donate $1 for every new Facebook like or Instagram follow to a local nonprofit. I’m hoping the final tally is well over $1,000\!

**The bottom line:** When it comes to your client events, have a plan, but make sure you adjust your purpose so your clients don’t get burned out from them. If you’d like to talk more about client event ideas or there’s anything else we can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Wolek Group. We’d love to help you, and we wish you a happy holiday season.
