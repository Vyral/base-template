EGGFest is a unique event with delicious food; but the eggs here aren’t what you think.

Today, Sandie and I are coming to you from the annual EGGFest at Brownsboro Hardware & Paint.

Before we move on to what’s going on here at EGGFest, let’s talk a little bit about our market. The first piece of news is that interest rates, while they’re staying steady for now, won’t stay as low as they are forever.

But what about our local Louisville market? For one thing, the number of homes sold in July is down 2.3% from where it was last year. This is all due to a lack of inventory—15.1% fewer homes are on the market than there were last July.

This puts us firmly in a seller’s market. In fact, right now we’re sitting at 2.93 months of inventory. However, homes in higher price ranges are seeing something much different. While lower-priced homes are moving more quickly off the market, higher-end homes are actually in a buyer’s market.

In other words, **people looking to sell and make the move up to a higher price range are in a great position.** They’ll be able to sell their lower price point home for top dollar before turning around to get a fantastic deal.

Currently, lower-priced homes are in strong demand. Many people are growing tired of renting and are ready to become homeowners. Overall, the market is hot—especially in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range.

In fact, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun recently said that “Homes are are coming off the market at an extremely fast pace and the prevalence of multiple offers in some markets are pushing prices higher.” This is something we’re absolutely seeing here in Louisville.

But let’s get back to EGGFest.  According to Jim Lehrer of Brownsboro Hardware & Paint, this is the festival’s ninth year—and this year’s turnout is bigger than ever before. **Last year, EGGFest raised over $20,000 for two local charities.** With such a great crowd, the money raised this year is expected to far exceed last year’s number.

The atmosphere at EGGFest is unlike anything else. But these aren’t the kind of eggs you cook—they’re the kind you cook with. Throughout the event there are rows and rows of Big Green Eggs—kamado-style ceramic charcoal barbeque grills. As is obvious from all the delicious looking and tasting food, these Big Green Eggs can cook just about anything.

One attendee we spoke to, Jamie Longacre, said **she couldn’t choose a favorite between all the things to eat here at EGGFest.** “You can’t go wrong here,” she told us.

From pork to burgers to pizza to even real eggs, there’s no shortage of things to try. In fact, even first-time attendees have said they already own, or plan on getting, their very own Big Green Egg.

We spoke to attendees and vendors alike, but the consensus was the same across the board: the food is delicious and the event is like nothing else around.

Some of the things to try here are as unique as the event itself. Dan Lambert, one of the chefs at EGGFest, was even making what he called “grilled lemonade.” The finished treat was a half lemon dipped in sugar, caramelized on a grill, and then made into lemonade.

There are even certain attachments designed to transform the Green Egg into different tools. The Pizza Porta, for example, turns it into the perfect pizza oven.

When everything was said and done, Sandie, who had never been to EGGFest before, gave the event a 12 out of 10 rating.

You won’t want to miss next year’s EGGFest, which is on the first Friday and Saturday of August in 2018. We hope to see you there.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
