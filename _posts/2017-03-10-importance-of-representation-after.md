Today I’m back with part two of the “Importance of Representation After Contract” to go over why you need to have representation during the appraisal process.

I’m back for part two of the “Importance of Representation After Contract.” Today I’ll go over the why it’s so important to keep your representation during the appraisal process.

So what is an appraisal?

**An appraisal is a valuation done on a property by a professional known as an appraiser.**

On the buyer’s side, if the appraisal does not come in at the contract price, you have three options. The first is to walk away from the sale. The second is to ask the seller to come down in price to the appraised value and the third is to meet somewhere in the middle. However, the third option requires the buyer to come up with extra cash out of pocket.

The seller, on the other hand, needs to sell their home first to the buyer and then to the appraiser. **We help our sellers by providing an appraiser with anything they might need to see the value in a home that the seller and the buyer have agreed to.**

A gentleman once came into my office whose home had been on the market for more than 160 days. He finally thought he had it sold, but the appraisal came in $30,000 lower than what he and the buyer had agreed to. He couldn’t reduce the price that low, so the sale fell through. I went through his appraisal and I found a few things that weren’t quite right. Unlike his agent, I would have disputed the appraisal to see if we could get a more accurate value.

I believe this is a great example of why you need to make sure you have representation even after the contract is signed. We work very hard for our clients during the appraisal process and really try to make sure they are taken care of all the way through closing.

If you have any further questions about this topic or you have any other real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
