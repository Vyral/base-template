<center><em>Stop by our office on November 19 &amp; 20 for a free pie or homemade wine!</em></center>

&nbsp;

It’s our favorite time of year—the time for football, food, Thanksgiving, and also our annual Pie & Wine Giveaway.

**Join us at our office on November 19 and 20 between 3 PM and 6 PM, and you can receive a free pie or a bottle of homemade wine.**

Not only is the wine homemade, but, in fact, we made it ourselves. We enjoy the process; it’s definitely a labor of love, but we do it because **it’s our way of spending Thanksgiving with you**. Our bottle on your table means we’re, in some way, a part of your family. However, I promise I won’t be baking the pie, since I can’t bake.
