If you’re selling your home in our hot South Florida market, you need to work with a skilled, experienced real estate professional. When selecting a Realtor, though, how can you know which one’s right for you?&nbsp;

To give you an example of what you should look for in a listing agent, **we’ll tell you how the RealtyGirls do business when selling homes.**&nbsp;

We have more to offer than just sticking a sign in your yard and coordinating showings. We’re up to date about the latest market conditions affecting your neighborhood and community and we can offer valuable guidance when pricing your home. This is important in a hot real estate market because if you’re just taking your pricing guidance from Zillow, you’re potentially selling yourself short and losing money from the sale of your home.&nbsp;

**Our innovative marketing strategies include the best technologies and online resources** to ensure your home has the necessary web appeal and maximum exposure worldwide to generate multiple offers, which we have become well-known for.&nbsp;

We pride ourselves in providing excellent communication throughout the sale of your home as we build a relationship that will extend well beyond the close of your transaction.&nbsp;

While your home is on the market, we can act as a buffer and take the spam out of your showings and handle all of the buyer’s agents for you. You don’t want to have to filter through all the calls of different requests for people to get into your home. Our team is prepared to handle that for you.&nbsp;

**Once a buyer has been identified, we have the negotiation skills to get top dollar for your home,** and we handle all the paperwork for you. We can help guide you through the entire process, because it can be overwhelming.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about using a real estate professional to sell your home or you have a home you need to sell, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to work with you soon!
