<center><em>Here are a few key tips that first-time homebuyers need to keep in mind.</em></center>

<br>To help first-time homebuyers find success, we first recommend that you get your finances in order. To get a loan, you need to be pre-approved by a lender, have your credit score checked, and save enough money for a down payment and your closing costs.

Next, you need to **hire a great agent who can help you prepare for the process**. At Healthy Realty, we have so many team members who would love to help you, no matter your price range. We’ll walk you through the process and help you understand how you can beat out other buyers so you can win in this market.

One of the ways we recommend to find a great agent is to **go on Zillow**. Zillow has all the reviews from an agent’s past clients, and there are over 6,000 agents in the area, so it’s important to find the right match. We at Healthy Realty have over 500 reviews from past customers, and you can also find our sales history to demonstrate our experience in this area.

Contact the Healthy Realty Team today if you’re in the market to buy your first home or if you have any sort of real estate questions. We’d love to be your resource.
