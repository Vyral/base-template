If you’re interested in selling your home, you may have the same question as most homeowners: What can we do to sell our home and get top dollar? As a real estate agent, I’ve learned it’s not just about what you do but how you do it. It used to be that you put a sign in the yard, placed your home on the market, and prayed it would sell for top dollar. These days buyers are more sophisticated, knowledgeable, and aware of what’s for sale.

The following tips will help you get 2.7% more for the sale of your home, meaning that for a $300,000 home, you’ll net $8,100 more. **Here are the three components that are crucial to selling your home for top dollar:**

**1\. Preparation**. If you’re selling a used car and trying to get a good price, you wouldn’t even dream of showing it before you washed, waxed, and detailed it. The same principle applies to your home. You need to prepare your home if you want the most out of it.

**2\. Price**. If you overprice your home, all the preparation in the world isn’t going to make a difference, even in the current seller’s market. Price strategy is key to selling for top dollar.

**3\. Promotion**. Today’s tech-savvy and mobile buyers are looking for their next home online. That means you need aggressive, cutting-edge internet and social marketing strategies to ensure your success.
