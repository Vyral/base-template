Today I have an exciting opportunity I knew I needed to rush to tell you about because it’s that big. It has to do with owning a home in Utah; there’s some crazy data you need to know about.

From the second quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022, the average home value in Utah increased by $71,000. These homeowners didn’t have to do anything special to raise values; they just paid their mortgages on time. Additionally, while values were increasing, homeowners were paying down the principal owed on their mortgages. As a result, the average U.S. homeowner has $300,000 in equity, which is huge\!

It doesn’t stop there - this phenomenon of home prices going up didn’t start last year. **If you purchased a home in 1991, you’ve seen an average increase of 621% on your investment.** Meaning - if you bought a $150,000 home back then, it’s now worth a whopping $930,000\!&nbsp;

So, should you buy real estate? Let me put it this way: I just doubled down on my personal investment in real estate during a market with rising interest rates *and* fluctuating prices. **I couldn’t be more confident that this is the safest bet you can make with your money.**

Please call or email me if you have questions about this topic or anything else. I’d love to discuss your financial plans with you.
