<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a friendly reminder of our primary passion as a real estate team.</em></p>

Over the last decade, my real estate team and I have worked so hard to help medical families as they relocate into and move out of Charleston. I’ve been married to a physician for over 20 years now; we got married right before he started medical school, so **I understand the whole medical family journey**—from med school to residency and fellowships, to finally being an attending physician or a practitioner.&nbsp;

We’ve bought and sold homes through every phase of the process, so I would love to be a resource for you if you have any questions about buying a home. Just reach out to me and I’d be more than happy to set up a phone call or Zoom conference with you to discuss your specific needs as a buyer. If you’re interested in selling, I’d love the chance to meet with you at your home and highlight the best things you can do to prepare it for the market.&nbsp;

Let me know how I can be of assistance to you\! **If you’re looking to put your real estate plans into action come 2021, Healthy Realty would love to help you.** As always, thank you for your support, stay safe, and have a wonderful holiday season\!
