<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Today, well talk about the dynamics of the Portland real estate market. Well also examine why our **inventory levels are causing relative appreciation in our area.  ** 

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Portland continues to experience a **brisk, fast-paced real estate market**. Part of that is due to healthy job growth, and Portland has also been ranked as one of the best places to live in several publications. **There arent many homes for sale**, but demand is skyrocketing. 

If a real estate market has less than 6 months of inventory, its considered a sellers market. **In a sellers market, home prices go up.** A neutral market has 6 to 7 months of inventory, and home prices will only appreciate due to inflation. A buyers market has more than 7 months of inventory, and prices will depreciate.

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**Portland is in a firm sellers market.** Beaverton has less than a month of inventory. Northwest Portland has a month-and-a-half of inventory. Northeast Portland has about a months worth of inventory, and **North Portland has 6/10ths of a month of inventory.** This is what were seeing across Portland, especially in entry level price ranges. 

Since homes are in such high demand, if youre a buyer, **you will probably face multiple offer situations. **We recently helped a client make an offer on a property. Hes in escrow right now, but he had made 7 other offers on different properties before this one was accepted. Its very competitive right now.
