{% include youtube.html %}I’m on the hunt for an investment property in the TU/Midtown area. These kinds of properties are hard to find, so I’d love your help.

Usually, I’m the one helping buyers. Today though, I’m the one who’s buying.

**I’m looking to buy an investment property around the TU/Midtown area for anywhere up to $125,000.** I would love one that has three bedrooms, but I’d be fine with two bedrooms as well. One or 1.5 bathrooms would be ideal.

Midtown is a great place to live, so these kinds of properties are hard to find. If you’re thinking about selling your home and don’t have it on the market yet, I would love to talk to you and see if I could be your buyer.

If you know of anyone else making a move from or selling an investment property that’s already being leased in that area, don’t hesitate to send them my way.

If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call at (918) 712-2252 or send me an email at info@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
