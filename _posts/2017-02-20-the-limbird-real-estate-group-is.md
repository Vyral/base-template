At the Limbird Real Estate Group, we are proud to always be on the cutting edge of technology. This is why we are thrilled to announce our adoption of 3-D home tours. Buying a home can be a taxing process, especially for out-of-town buyers. Typically, Realtors use still photos and some use video to market their homes to buyers. This is only a 2-D experience, however.

 We are investing in a three-dimensional experience for our buyers and sellers. Open houses are usually only held for a few hours each week. With our easy-to-navigate 3-D tours, however, your home can be open 24/7, 365 days a year.

We take you beyond the real world with a complete digital scan that gives buyers an unprecedented insight into your home like never before. With the use of lasers and high-tech cameras, potential buyers can select any room to view and instantly place themselves inside that space with the ability to maneuver inside the room and view it in 360 degrees. Buyers will be able to virtually walk through your home, get a feel for its layout, and notice details and features that they typically wouldn’t with still images.

 When you combine the fact that the majority of homebuyers start their search online with the power of photos being shared on social media, this is an amazing tool for a seller like yourself to take advantage of. Our team currently advertises on more than 100 websites and we’re ready to put our state-of-the-art technology to work for you.

 If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
