Today we're talking about the Federal Housing Administration and some changes they've just made to help first-time homebuyers. **About 40% of first-time homebuyers have student debt.** Over the last five years, mortgage brokers and mortgage banks have had to factor student debt into their debt-to-income ratio calculation.

If you have $1,000 worth of student debt that you pay every month, then youâ€™ll qualify for $1,000 less on your loan. This has a major effect on buyers being able to borrow for a mortgage or buy a home, so the Federal Housing Administration released a statement on June 18 saying that **mortgage lenders can no longer factor in student debt to qualify for a mortgage.**

This will open up a lot of opportunities for first-time homebuyers who are carrying student debt and who otherwise, in the past few years, would not have been able to buy a house.

If you have student debt and want to find out more about buying a house or see if you qualify now, give us a call at 704-626-2479 or visit us online at&nbsp;[thewhitegroupblog.com](https://thewhitegroupblog.com/).
