One of the greatest things about being in real estate is the people that you meet along the way and the memories you share with the people that you serve.

**I recently got back from one of the most amazing vacations.**I’ve been snowboarding since I was a kid, and I’ve always been really into the outdoors.

I just got back from Bella Coola in British Columbia. Bella Coola is one of the most remote mountain regions in the world. There are 2.5 million acres of terrain. You have to take a prop plane, a two-day boat ride, or drive through the mountains for 12 hours to get to civilization, a.k.a. Vancouver.

**I was able to share this amazing experience with three different people that I’ve served in real estate transactions.**They all had a passion for skiing or snowboarding like I did. I put the trip together on a whim, and we just got back with some great memories that we will share for the rest of our lives.

Check out the video above for a short film of our skiing adventure. I hope to create some great memories with you as well.

If you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
