Technology has changed the real estate market for better, especially for home sellers. Here’s how.

As many of you know, I come from a production background and photography is one of my hobbies. Photography, and technology in general, has really made a huge difference in the real estate industry in the last decade or so. **Today I want to talk about how this technology has really helped our sellers sell their homes.**

For all of our seller’s listings, we have a professional photographer who comes out to take pictures. We also utilize a full video tour that incorporates drone photography to give buyers a really good idea of what a property actually looks like.

**Things have changed immensely, even from just two or three years ago when we started using video tours.** Now, buyers can get a very detailed idea of what the home looks like before they ever see it in person.

While we do some broker tours on Fridays, we’ve found that most buyers, since they’ve been able to see what the home is like online, don’t even come out to the tours anymore.&nbsp;

With this technology, we were recently able to sell a house to an overseas buyer. We were able to use my cell phone to be able to do a live, virtual tour for them after they saw the home online.

When I first started in real estate, everything was paper and facts. Times have changed, to say the least. Whether it’s with electronic signatures, video tours, or drone photography, **it has all made the real estate process easier for all properties involved.**

Does this mean you don’t need a real estate agent anymore? No, you still need the experience and guidance of an agent to help you through the process from beginning to end.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
