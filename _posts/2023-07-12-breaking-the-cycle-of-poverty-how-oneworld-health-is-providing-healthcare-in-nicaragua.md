Did you know that **for every closing we oversee, we provide health care to 30 people** that are in need in underprivileged areas? We partner with OneWorld Health to support the healthcare needs of people in Uganda and Nicaragua. My family and I just returned from a mission trip to Nicaragua, where we had a wonderful time working with OneWorld Health and a team of local Nicaraguan doctors and nurses to provide medical care.

In the places OneWorld Health serves, basic healthcare is never guaranteed – government healthcare systems are overwhelmed and underfunded; there aren’t enough doctors, supplies, and medicine; and too many patients who can’t afford treatment. All of this adds up to a powerful recipe for prolonging poverty.
