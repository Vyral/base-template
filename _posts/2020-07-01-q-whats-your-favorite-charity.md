*We want to give back to our community, and we want your suggestions.*

Today I want to thank you all for your support because we’re celebrating some records in our business. Last year we had the opportunity to help 70 families make the right move. This year, as of this recording, we’ve currently helped over 50 families\! This wasn’t a specific goal we set, but something that happened organically. We’re truly grateful for all the opportunities we’ve been given.&nbsp;

One of the things we hold deep in our hearts is our ability to make a difference in our community. Normally, this time of year we host a client appreciation event called Bark at the Park where we partner with local charities for animal welfare, and try to get them adopted so they can find their forever homes. Due to the pandemic, we will not be hosting that event this year. However, **we want to take a portion of our profits and set it aside to still help animal welfare, family support, and homelessness.&nbsp;**

Please reply to this email with your favorite charity; we want to know what’s important to you. As we plan our success, we want to continue to invest back into the community that has given us so much.&nbsp;

For our business, **we currently have over 140 five-star reviews** on Yelp, Zillow, Google, and Facebook. Thank you for taking the time to give us a positive review\! If there’s anything we can do to help you, please contact us. We know these are unique times, and for some, they’re difficult times.&nbsp;

We’re going to continue moving forward while practicing safety measures because, at the end of the day, our goal is to continue to help any way we can.

If you have questions or there’s any way we can help you reach your real estate goals, please call or email me at AlexYu@FirstTeamEstates.com. I look forward to speaking with you.
