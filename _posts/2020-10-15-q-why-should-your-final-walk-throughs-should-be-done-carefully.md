*Here’s why this step is arguably the most important in the home buying process.*

The final walk-through of a home is incredibly important, as it’s the final action before signing the documents and closing the sale. It’s also the time for buyers to make sure everything that was negotiated during your option period, like certain repairs, has indeed been taken care of—**once you close, the home is yours and any problems found thereafter will be your responsibility.**

This crucial step isn’t just for resale homes, either. For new construction buyers, the final walk-through allows you to ensure that the builder is providing you with everything that they said they would.&nbsp;
