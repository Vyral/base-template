Imagine receiving MORE money for your home than you thought was ever possible. This is a reality for the real estate market in 2020\! Families just like yours have continued to buy and sell homes even throughout the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and are profiting. We’re sure you’ve wondered when a great time of the year is to make the move and put your home on the market. And you may be ready to list after spending 2 months cooped up inside\! After an analysis of 33.6 million home sales within the last nine years, we’ve concluded that homes listed during the summer months receive better offers\!&nbsp;

On these days in June, we have seen sellers enjoy up to 10.5% premium above market value\!\! For example, on average the median estimated value for homes was around $184,000 while the median sales price was around $204,000. That’s an opportunity for an additional $20,000 profit from selling your home during the summer months\!

With buyer demand higher than ever, sellers have the upper hand to make more of a profit when they choose to sell.
