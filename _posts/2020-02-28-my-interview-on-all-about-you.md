<br>Today I’ll show you a recent guest spot I did on the TV show “All About You” with host Rodrigo Ballon. In this wide-ranging interview, I talk about what motivated me in my real estate career, why there’s nowhere else I’d rather work than North County, and what I predict for the rest of the 2020 market.
