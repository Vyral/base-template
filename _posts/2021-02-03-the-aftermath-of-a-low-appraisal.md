&nbsp;Your options if the appraised value doesn’t meet the contract price.&nbsp;

What if the appraised value doesn’t meet the contract price? If your home’s appraised value comes in low, it’s possible to get it adjusted. Just like the rest of us in this busy market, appraisers are swamped, and a low appraisal may be due to human error.&nbsp;

If you don’t find any errors in your home’s appraisal but still disagree with its findings, **your Realtor can submit a rebuttal and get the price adjusted.** Getting the appraised value adjusted is certainly a challenge, but it’s not impossible. You’ll need your Realtor to prepare a list of comps that they feel are appropriate, as well as a list of updates and upgrades your home has had, and submit it to the lender for consideration. If you and your Realtor have exhausted all means of adjustment and it’s just not working out, it’s time for you to go back to the seller to renegotiate.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
