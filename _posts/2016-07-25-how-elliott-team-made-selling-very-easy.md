It actually sold before it actually was on the market. We got an offer before the open house actually, before it was listed, and just trying to ensure that all the questions were addressed and ensuring that it was a quality offer and making it a very easy decision on our part. It was a very stress free environment which I think was pretty unique.”</span></span></i>
