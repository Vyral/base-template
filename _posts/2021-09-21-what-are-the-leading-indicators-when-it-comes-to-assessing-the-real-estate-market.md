Scott has been asked almost everyday with the following questions: How is the market? What is going on today that I need to know as a buyer or seller in the real estate market? He gives three indicators and explains them in a language that is simple and easy to understand.

The first indicator is inventory. Inventory is the amount of homes available on the market and how long will it take for those homes to sell if there are no new homes coming in the market. In a normal market, this is about 6 months worth of homes.&nbsp;

Earlier this year, in most of LA county, there is under a month of supply on the market. This results to multiple offers and homes selling over their list price.

The second indicator is list-to-sales price. List-to-sale price is the percentage of the list price versus the sales price. If the property is listed at $1 million and sold at $900,000, the list-to-sales price is 90%. Normally, the list-to-sales price is on the high 90s.&nbsp;

Early this year, the list-to-sales price is over 100%. Meaning, homes on the market are being sold over their list price, giving top dollars to the owners.

The last indicator is days-on-the-market. It means how long does it take for a home to sell in the market. In the San Fernando Valley, the days-on-the-market is 2-3 weeks. Although this time has increased, this is still a record low time to be able to sell your property.

These three indicators are very important as they affect the pricing and market strategy. If you are interested in selling your home and in need of expert advice, Scott is the man you are looking for\!
