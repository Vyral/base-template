Are the rising home prices we’re seeing a result of greedy builders and homeowners, or is something else causing it? We’ve been involved in nearly 1,500 real estate transactions as a team. We were selling before the 2005 boom, through the crash, the foreclosure market, and the incredible ascent of the last five years.

Let me remind you of something: Buyers set prices. **The buyers determine the market**. You shouldn’t be blaming sellers or builders for rising prices if buyers are agreeing to pay them.

We need to let go of the idea that people are being greedy in this market. The sellers, builders, and developers are all you and me. If you were trying to sell your home right now, you would try to sell for the highest price possible, right?

Buyers set prices and determine value. **If they stopped paying those prices, prices would decrease.** Until then, they are what they are.

If you have any questions for me about buying, selling, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
