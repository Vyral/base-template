Today I’m with Dianna Silver of Home Warranty of America to talk about how a home warranty coverage can benefit a home seller.

**A home warranty actually adds a ton of value to your home when you go to sell it.** It helps buyers realize that you care about what is inside the home. They protect the appliances and systems within the house including your fridge, furnace, washer, and dryer with a cap of $1500.

What is this going to cost sellers? Nothing. It’s complimentary for everyone that lists their home with us. There is also an optional $50 fee to cover your heating, cooling, and duct work. If a person decides not to move forward with the warranty or convert it to the buyer, no money is due even if a claim is made.

**Once the property closes and things move forward, the cost of repairs is going to depend on what plan you decide to offer.** Generally, a seller pays for the warranty. The best coverage is in the diamond plan, which includes things like replacing old appliances for $575. There are also plans that cost $450 and $525.

A home warranty can really assist a seller in that transitional period. It helps relieve some of that stress.
