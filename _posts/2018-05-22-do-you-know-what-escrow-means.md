What is escrow? Today I’ll discuss what it is and how it correlates with a real estate transaction.

**An escrow account is a deposit of funds, a deed, or assets that one party in a contract will deliver to the other party upon completion of a specific condition or event.**

The account is managed by a third party who is independent of the transaction. The most common form of escrow accounts are the ones used for real estate transactions. Real estate escrow accounts, also called pre-closing escrow accounts, are held by third-party entities that are separate from both the buyer and seller. These accounts hold all funds, instructions, and paperwork necessary for the impending sale, including funds for the down payment and the deed to the home.

**They are designed to protect the interests of both parties during what will probably be the largest and most complex transaction in their lives.**
