There are a few things almost all buyers resist: coming to meet us in our office so we can figure out the specifics of the property they are looking for, and meeting with a lender at the front end of the process instead of waiting. Today, we explain why doing both of those things are actually beneficial for all parties involved.

Sitting down with a real estate professional will save you time and frustration in the long run. Why? For one, you can save a lot of time by hashing out exactly what you require a home to have and what needs you want met. An agent will show you only homes that satisfy the requirement you laid out, so you don't have to waste time seeing homes you have no interest in buying. The initial interview is crucial if you want to save time and stress.

Talking with a lender is also a crucial part of the process that buyers would rather put off. However, we have had buyers who loved a home they saw, went to get approved by a lender, but were unable to purchase the home once they were approved because someone else had already gotten to it. When you have approval up front, we can act quickly to get the home you like under contract and negotiate a very good deal for you.

As you can see, sitting down with an agent and seeing a lender before jumping headfirst into the buying process can be incredibly beneficial. If you have any further questions on this or any other real estate topic, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're proud to be your number one source for real estate information here in Southern Arizona!
