Where are the best places to spend money on improvements in your home in order to get the highest return? Here are a few of the best and most inexpensive fixes you can make:

**1. Update your paint and carpet with neutral colors<br>2. Get rid of wallpaper<br>3. Update your light fixtures<br>4. Add a deck or patio (or refinish the one you already have)**

These are great improvements that add value to your home whether you’re ready to sell now, in six months, or in a year. By making these upgrades now, you can enjoy the benefits of them while you’re still in the home. **If you make the repairs right before you move, you won’t be able to enjoy them as much.**Getting repairs done now before you sell also allows you to focus on other important things when the time comes to list your home on the market.
