Today I am at the Las Vegas Raiders Preview Center, where you can celebrate the Raidersâ€™ greatest moments in history and learn about the brand-new Las Vegas Stadium. Before that, though, I want to talk to you about season tickets.

**You can reserve your tickets now for the Las Vegas Raiders for a deposit of only $100**. For the personal seat license (PSL) plus the season tickets, you could pay anywhere between $6,000 to $18,000.

The stadium, which is anticipated to be ready for the 2020 season, will host its first-ever game on July 31, 2020. It will be a very exciting time to have the team play here.

If you are interested in purchasing seats, tickets are available now. It is a great time to jump on board and claim your seats.

As always, if you are looking to buy or sell in Las Vegas, please feel free to call me. I look forward to speaking with you.
