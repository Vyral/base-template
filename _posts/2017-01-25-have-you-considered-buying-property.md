*This week I escaped the cold and traveled to the Caribbean.
Here’s some of what I learned about buying internationally.*

This week, I have escaped the cold and am coming to you from the Caribbean! I’ve been to quite a few islands, including Puerto Rico, Barbados, and many more.

**I’m traveling with a group of like-minded Realtors from all over North America who are interested in helping clients purchase international property.**

We have learned how to do safe transfers of large amounts of money and save people significant fees on international transfers. We’ve also learned about tax advantages, citizenship implications, and various other helpful things.

For example, Barbados is an English-speaking country that we have learned has quality, free healthcare and very low tax rates.

 We have seen properties of all price ranges, from modestly priced homes all the way up to the luxury market. We even saw a private estate that boasts its own marina!

It’s such a pleasure to be in this part of the world, and if you or anyone you know is interested in buying internationally, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to share what I’ve learned about the Caribbean or answer any questions you might have.
