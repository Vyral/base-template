I read a staggering statistic recently about how people—particularly millennials—are spending their money. The problem is, they haven’t figured out how to manage money.

My 12-year-old daughter Abby “entered” the workforce recently by doing some babysitting, and she’s been asking me a lot of questions since then about how to save and invest money. In response, I invited her to read the very first business book I ever read, **“The Richest Man in Babylon.”** My grandfather gave me this book when I was 14, and if you haven’t read it, it’s a great read.

At first, she felt a bit timid because it was her first business book and it was a whole different world she was stepping into, but she was surprised and pleased with how it turned out. Here are two key lessons she learned from it:

* **Get systematic in how you save your money.** In one particular chapter, one of the characters had a regimen of how he spent his money. For every 10 gold pieces he earned, two went to paying off his debts, seven went toward living expenses, and one he set aside for savings. What this teaches is money can either go to work for you and bring back some of its friends, be used toward buying things, or flee. If you make bad investments, you’ll never see that money again.
* **Make work your friend, not your enemy.** This lesson comes from another chapter where a man who was sold into slavery was told by another slave that he would get his freedom back if he made work his best friend.

In addition to having her read this great book, I also dug up a ledger I made of my work schedule when I was 12 years old. In this ledger, I logged where I was working, how many hours I was working, and what job site I was at. Back then, I was working nine-, 10-, and 12-hour days at construction sites. In this ledger, I also recorded the money I was saving and depositing in the bank.

Even though I had a ledger at age 12 and read “The Richest Man in Babylon” at age 14, I didn’t get serious about following the principles of saving money until I was about 21. To show Abby the power of these principles, I built her her own spreadsheet. In this spreadsheet, her goal is to set aside $20 per week. Down the road, whenever she gets married, if her husband puts aside $20 per week as well and they make an average of 12% interest, that equates to almost $2 million over the course of 40 years. At 15% interest, that would equal $4 million, all from just setting aside $20 per week and starting the habit of saving early.

To help her get excited about instilling this principle, I’ve pledged to match every dollar she saves this year so we can do some investing together. I’m proud to say she already has some pretty good ideas on how to make that money work.

**I encourage you to start having conversations with your own kids at a young age about saving money.** I want to stop this epidemic of people creating bad money-spending habits at a young age. They’re spending money faster than they earn it, and this will cause big problems for our country if we don’t start having these conversations with our kids, advising them on how to spend money appropriately, and how to save for their future.
