Jennie connected with President and CEO, Moises Echeverria, to hear about ways to support and connect with the Foundation of Tulsa Schools.

Whether it’s back to school or throughout the school year, The Foundation works closely with Tulsa Public Schools to provide district-wide funding support to help advance the goals and vision of the district.

The Foundation offers an array of ways to get involved and help contribute to the next generations success. Through programs like Partners in Education (PIE) have the opportunity to become involved through two avenues, Adopt a School or The Foundation for Tulsa School Partners Scholarships.

The Foundation’s book series is another great outlet that allows sponsors to help in supporting the creation of books that highlight Tulsa’s unique attributes, promote reading literacy among students, and instill within children and adults a sense of pride for our amazing city! Current books include, Good Night Tulsa and Celebrate Tulsa, both sold a select retailers throughout Tulsa.

The Foundation also hosts supply drives throughout the year to ensure teachers are equipped with everything they need to make their students successful.
