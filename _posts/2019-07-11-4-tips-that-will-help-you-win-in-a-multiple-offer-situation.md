If you’re a buyer and you’re competing in a multiple-offer situation, **here are four quick tips you need to remember if you want to write the strongest offer possible.&nbsp;**

First, don’t ask for a lot of personal property or closing costs in the offer.&nbsp;

Next, try to get the best financing—make sure you have a pre-approval letter from a mortgage lender to go along with your offer.&nbsp;

After that, try minimizing your contingencies. If you need to sell your current home before you buy, structure your offer so that needing to wait for another house to sell sounds more appealing than it is.&nbsp;

Finally, have your agent put you in the best position possible\!
