Has your definition of home changed? If so, you’re not alone this year.

As a real estate agent, I’m the one someone calls when they need to buy or sell a home. What 2020 has taught us is what people truly love about their home and what they can’t stand. **So many paradigms have shifted in terms of how we work, educate, and live together.**

Just last year, if you worked in an office, you may be home for weekends and just a few hours on weekdays. Everything has turned on its side now and people are home 24/7 with their families. A lot of homeowners have realized they need fewer open spaces and more rooms for school and work. Others need better internet service or just more space in general.

**If there are things in your home that you're not super thrilled about, I’d love you to reach out to me.** We can help you come up with ideas to either improve your current home or find a new one that you truly love.

If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
