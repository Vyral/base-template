People ask me all the time, “How did you get started in real estate?”

Today I would like to tell you the answer to this question. So, let’s take a look back at how I got my start.

I entered this industry back in 2003 when I got my license and began working as part of a real estate team. This chapter in my career lasted until about 2008, when I left the team and took a few years off from this path.&nbsp;

Ultimately, though, I did come back. I got a new license in 2012 and started up the team that I am still leading today. Since then, **I have built my business to be among the top real estate professionals on the North Shore of Chicago and the No. 1 producer in Northbrook.&nbsp;**

And, actually, being in the business prior to founding my current team proved to be a great benefit as I re-entered the industry. It gave me time to really focus on my business plan, as well as my plan for daily activities. Immediately after re-entering real estate, I was very committed to dedicating certain days and times to being in the office working on my business plan. From the very beginning, my goal was to be the No.1 agent in Northbrook. I wanted people in this community to think of me as their go-to real estate professional.

So, once I had developed a plan, I began reaching out to people. I started sending out emails, I took out a little bit of advertising space, and I began providing market evaluations for community members. And I did this because whether people are moving or not, everyone loves real estate.

**Diving deeper into real estate was a slow-going process, but I kept going.** I continued to put my name out there and provide services for the community, knowing that it would eventually pay off. After about six months of doing this, people began to notice. They would say things like, “You’re everywhere!”&nbsp;

In actuality, I wasn’t everywhere. I was just making sure to stay visible in the places that mattered. I kept my focus small and found my niche. Doing this, in my opinion, is one of the keys to building a business. **Being persistent without making people feel as though they are being constantly sold to is what put me on the path to success.** If you hope to build a business, you have to show people what kind of value you can provide for them.&nbsp;

Even if someone has no immediate real estate need, it is good to establish yourself as a resource. That way when the time does come for them to make a move, they know who to reach out to.&nbsp;

Another way I got my start and established myself within the community was by hosting roundtable discussions about Northbrook. Doing this allowed me to meet a lot of people without spending a lot of money in the process.&nbsp;

Everything you do as an agent should be done with a certain question in mind: **“What do people need and want from you as a real estate agent?”**

Being an agent is not about being a salesperson, it is about being someone who the community can turn to for their real estate needs. If you work toward this and do so consistently, you are sure to find success in your business.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
