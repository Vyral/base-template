In Money Magazine’s list of top 50 places to live in the U.S., two cities in the East Bay made the cut: San Ramon and Fremont.

**Money Magazine recently came out with their list of the 50 best places to live in the U.S.** They looked at factors such as taxes, health care, education, jobs, and home affordability. It was no surprise to us that two of the cities on this list are right here in the East Bay.

**Coming in at number 21 is San Ramon.** They are calling it “mini-Irvine.” With new neighborhoods, parks, and the headquarters for Chevron and 24-Hour Fitness in their backyard, this is a fantastic place to live and work. If you would like more information about San Ramon, reach out to us and we would be glad to send you some great resources.

**At number 46 on the list is Fremont.** This is a city with a diverse culture, as well as a great economy. It’s also very close to Silicon Valley.

If you have any questions about any of the cities on the list or here in the East Bay, we would love to talk. There are a ton of great ones out there. Give us a call or send us an email today.
