When you purchase a home, there’s a general timeline you’ll typically be following.&nbsp;

With Vision Realty, you’d sit down for an initial consultation where we’d analyze your needs, find out what you’re looking for, and establish a working relationship.

Next, we’ll sit you down with a lender and get you a pre-approval for a mortgage loan. **After this is completed, we’ll email you homes to preview and schedule showings for the properties you choose.** When you pick the home you want to buy, we’ll get the property under contract and start the inspection process.

A professional home inspector will look through your home and make you aware of repairs that must be made. **We’ll negotiate repairs with the seller to make sure the items are taken care of.**

After negotiations, the lender will go through the mortgage underwriting process and have the property appraised. Once it’s underwritten, the loan will be approved and we’ll be ready to close on the house. The title company will make sure liens and mortgages are paid off by the sale’s proceeds. Finally, you get the keys to your new home\!

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
