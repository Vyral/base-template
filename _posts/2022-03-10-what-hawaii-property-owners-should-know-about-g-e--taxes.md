I don't consider myself a tax expert, but I have been dealing with general excise taxes, or G.E. taxes, for most of my career. All Realtors are required to pay a 4.5% general excise tax in Hawaii if they’re making income from rentals.

**It’s a complicated process, so I recommend reaching out to a tax professional to discuss Hawaii’s G.E. taxes.** We can provide that service through a CPA for a small fee.

If you have any questions about G.E. taxes or anything else related to property management, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
