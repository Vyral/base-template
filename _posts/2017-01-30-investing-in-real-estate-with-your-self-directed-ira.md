Today Kaaren Hall, the CEO of uDirect IRA Services, joins us to discuss investing in real estate with your IRA funds.

<br>In 1975, Gerald Ford enacted a law that allowed IRAs to be self-directed. Most CPAs will tell you that you can’t invest in real estate with your IRA, but you absolutely can. **It’s a simple, three-step process.**

<br>First, you have to open an account. Once the account is opened, you fund the IRA by putting money into it. After it’s been opened and funded, then you can use your IRA to invest in something like a piece of real estate.

<br>**Most people make the mistake of thinking that when you invest with your IRA, you are pulling money out of your IRA.** That is a common misconception. When you invest in real estate with your IRA, it’s like when you have a regular IRA account that owns stock. You don’t pull money out of the IRA to buy the stock; the IRA buys it.

<br>The same principle applies to the self-directed IRA. The IRA is investing in an asset, which happens to be real estate. The IRA buys the property 100%. It’s just like a cash transaction; the money gets wired to close and you go from there.

<br>It’s important to understand that while an IRA can borrow money, you shouldn’t get a conventional loan. You can’t make a personal guarantee to a loan to your IRA; that is a prohibited transaction. You can get a non-recourse loan.

<br>Other prohibited transactions include buying, selling, or exchanging assets from your IRA with any lineal ascendant or descendant or fiduciary to the plan. That means that you cannot buy, sell, or exchange assets with your spouse, parents or children.

<br>When you use your IRA to invest in real estate, you cannot buy a primary residence or vacation home. You must buy an investment property.

<br>**If someone rents out the investment property, tenants will make the check payable to the custodian for the benefit of your IRA.** If you have a property manager, they will collect the rent and withhold some of the money to cover small expenses. All of the money that comes in from an IRA must go back into it; similarly, all expenses must be paid for by the IRA.

<br>Once you hit retirement age, you will be able to take your assets out of your IRA without a penalty. If you are withdrawing cash, you will send in a withdrawal form and the cash will be sent to you. If you are withdrawing a non-cash asset, like a house, you will need to get an appraisal so that the IRA company knows the appraised value of the property. Then, you will submit the appraisal along with the withdrawal form. The non-cash asset will be dispersed for you, and you will receive a 1099R on the appraised value.

<br>Investing in real estate with your IRA may seem like a daunting process, but it’s absolutely doable. If you have any questions for Kaaren, send an email to [info@uDirectIRA.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(105,110,102,111,64,117,68,105,114,101,99,116,73,82,65,46,99,111,109))) and you will get a response as soon as possible.
