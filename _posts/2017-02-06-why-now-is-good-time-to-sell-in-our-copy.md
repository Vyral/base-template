This time of year, we get a lot of people telling us they are going to wait to sell until spring or summer because there will be more buyers. While it’s true that there are a larger number of buyers in spring and summer, there is also a lot more inventory for buyers to choose from.

 In our market, we have a large relocation of clients that move in and out of the area each year. These people usually make their moves toward the end or beginning of the year. We also have a situation where sellers who took their homes off the market during the holidays are mostly waiting until spring to list.

This gives you a window of opportunity now in which there isn’t a lot of inventory, but you also have a ton of buyers looking and a time of year where people are getting their tax refunds or bonus checks. When buyers have extra money burning a hole in their pocket, they are ready to spend.

There aren’t a whole lot of homes for them to look at right now. The chances of selling your home more quickly and for a higher price are very good right now. It all depends on your situation, but things look good overall. Interest rates are also expected to go up three separate times this next year. That will further affect the number of buyers that look at your house.

 If you have any questions for us or want to sell your home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you out and give you the straight answer. We look forward to hearing from you!
