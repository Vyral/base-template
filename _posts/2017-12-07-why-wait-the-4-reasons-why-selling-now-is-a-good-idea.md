Today, let’s go over the top four reasons you should consider selling during the holiday season.

**1. Companies are looking for new talent.** Transferees will be starting their new jobs come the beginning of the year, and those people will need to find housing as soon as possible. In order to be able to take advantage of that, you’ll need to be on the market.

**2. Buyers are more serious.** Many buyers on the market will need to buy prior to the end of the year for tax purposes.

**3. Less competition.** During the holiday season, there are typically fewer homes on the market. This means less competition for you, and the less competition there is, the more money you can expect to get from your house.

**4. People have more time to view properties.** Typically, people have more time off during the holidays, which means they’ll have more time to dedicate to finding a home. What’s more, the buyers looking will be more serious. You don’t tend to find a lot of looky-loos in the middle of winter.
