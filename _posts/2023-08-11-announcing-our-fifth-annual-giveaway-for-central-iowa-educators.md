It’s August, which means it’s time to go back to school and announce our fifth annual giveaway for teachers! We are so thrilled to be able to support Central Iowa teachers for the fifth year in a row. This year, **we are giving away $5,000 in gift cards to 100 Central Iowa teachers** to help them prepare their classrooms for this coming school year.

We'd love for you to participate. **All you need to do is** [**follow this link**](http://www.soldincentraliowa.com/teachergiveaway) **to share about your favorite Central Iowa teacher.** The giveaway will be on August 22, and we can’t wait to hear from you. Also, if you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.
