Interest rates are on the rise in our market, so if you’re a homebuyer, you should definitely consider buying sooner rather than later.

How are market conditions and interest rates affecting homebuyers out there?

We’ve talked to a lot of people contemplating buying a home lately, and one of the common trends we’re seeing from homebuyers is wanting to wait 90 or 120 days before entering the market. If you feel the same way, **you might want to reevaluate that strategy with a real estate consultant.** In the last four months, we’ve seen interest rates go from 4.09% to 4.38%, and all indications are that they will continue to rise over the next 90 days.

Experts at the FMOC expect interest rates to be raised three times in 2018. Historically, interest rates have risen entering the spring markets even without the conditions we’re experiencing right now. Home prices tend to rise as well through this season.

This is why, if you’re thinking about buying a home, **meet with a real estate consultant, review your goals, and think about whether now is the time to dive into the market.** If you meet with us, we can perhaps create a strategy to purchase a home later in the year all while accomplishing the same goals.

If you’re on the fence, we’d love to give you a free consultation and examine the effects of waiting to enter the market. If you like to sit down with us or you have any other questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
