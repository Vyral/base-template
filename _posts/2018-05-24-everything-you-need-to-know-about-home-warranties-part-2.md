Today I’m back again with Dianna Silver from Home Warranty of America, to continue our series on home warranties and how they benefit homebuyers.

**When you think of a home warranty, PEACH is a helpful acronym to keep in mind to remember what a home warranty like this covers.** It stands for Plumbing, Electric, Appliances, Cooling, and Heating. A home warranty will help you as a new homebuyer with normal wear and tear breakdowns of any of these systems. Things like your fridge, washer and dryer, and all the major systems in your house.

**How long does a home warranty last?** For Dianna and HWA, they provide 13 months of coverage. They have a huge vendor base that can help with claims and get them serviced quickly.

If a buyer has an issue after closing, here’s what they would do. File a claim online at **[www.hwahomewarranty.com](https://www.hwahomewarranty.com/)**. **It’s very-user friendly, and by the time you press submit, a vendor will take the claim and schedule an appointment to come out and see what the issues are.**

How much does a warranty  cost? It depends on your plan. They offer Diamond coverage for $575, a Platinum plan for $525, and a Gold plan for $450. They can add on or subtract from these plans to make it work specifically for your home.

95% of the time the seller pays for the home warranty at closing and gets the coverage on the buyer’s behalf, and it's effective right at closing.
