Today, I’m here to tell you about our three big guarantees at Hawaii Pacific. As a property management company, there are limits to what we can promise, but we do have three guarantees:&nbsp;

**1\. Our communication guarantee.** If you call us, we'll call you back. This is the most important guarantee we offer.&nbsp;

**2\. The rent guarantee.** We'll give you in writing the lowest rent we can charge for your property, but we'll always aim for a higher amount. If we have to lower the rent after 30 days, we'll pay you the difference. This can get complicated, but that’s the overview.&nbsp;

**3\. The eviction guarantee.** If we evict a tenant we placed in your unit, we'll cover the eviction costs, which can range from $3,000 to $6,000.&nbsp;

These three guarantees set us apart from other property management companies. Other companies don’t offer this level of commitment, but we can guarantee our work. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. You can call or email us anytime and we would be happy to hear from you.
