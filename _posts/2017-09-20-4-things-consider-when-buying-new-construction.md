Today I have Jason Breitenstein with me to talk about four things you should consider when buying new construction.

Jason has been doing a great job on the team. Before he joined with us, he was actually in new construction sales for 13 years, becoming a regional trainer for his company. He’s a wealth of knowledge when it comes to new construction and real estate as a whole. Here are his tips for buying a new construction home that can save you some time and headaches:

1. **Be upgrade-aware.** When you’re going into a new model home, understand that the builder has strategically placed upgrades and items throughout the house that aren’t going to be standard with that standard price. So ask the right questions, know what the standards are, know what the upgrades are, and what they’ll cost.
2. **Not all materials are created equally.** As a buyer, I highly recommend that you go to the community that you’re looking at and really take a look at the homes under construction, and the raw materials being used. Each builder is different, but even then, each community is different as well. The purchasing manager buys their own materials and those can vary from good quality to very subpar materials, if they’re trying to save money. Do your due diligence—look at the lumber, look at the raw materials, and look at all the pieces that factor into it.
3. **Be prepared for delays.** A good builder will factor in weather delays when they give you a construction timeline. Have a backup plan—know whether you’ll need to stay with family, friends, or at a hotel, or if you’ll have to stay in your existing house for a longer period of time.
4. **Hire an agent to represent you through the process of a new construction build.** A lot of buyers don’t realize that they have the right to representation, even when they’re buying through a builder. It will save you many headaches because your Realtor is going to be dealing directly with the builder, making sure that you’re getting a good value with what you’re spending and ascertaining that the products that you’re selecting to go in the house are correct. **This service is free to you as a buyer.**
