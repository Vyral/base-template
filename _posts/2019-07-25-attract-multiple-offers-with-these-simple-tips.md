If you want to attract multiple offers to your property, there are a few simple tips you can employ.

**First, make sure your property looks great inside and out.** Spruce up your curb appeal with strategic landscaping and by giving your home’s exterior a fresh coat of paint, and make sure your interior looks just as stunning by having your property professionally staged.&nbsp;

If you can’t afford professional staging or just aren’t interested in it, you should still declutter and depersonalize your home to the best of your ability. Your agent should be able to help offer tips on how to make your specific home look and feel its best before buyers step through the door.&nbsp;

**Once your home looks up-to-par for the market, it’s time to get some professional photos.** Most buyers begin their home search online, which means the photos you choose to represent your listing will be their first impression of your property. Make sure you make a good one.&nbsp;

Having a strong marketing plan in place will also play a major role in attracting multiple offers. **You may even want to ask your agent about possibly advertising your home as a “coming soon” listing.** By making buyers aware of your home before it hits the market, you’ll be able to generate interest ahead of time. When buyers are excited about your property, they’ll be more keen to compete with one another to make sure they submit the winning offer.&nbsp;
