Which renovations should you make to your home if you want the biggest return on your investment? When it comes to home improvements, there are always two areas I highlight to my homeowners:

**1\. The kitchen.** This is one of the most important rooms in the house to a buyer, so making improvements on things like the countertops, flooring, appliances, and cabinetry can go a long way in boosting your home’s value.

**2\. The master bathroom.** Buyers are starting to look for bathrooms that create a spa experience. That can include different shower amenities, the type of tub, and the sink fixtures. Investing in these areas will no doubt draw their eyes.

Before you spend a lot of money to take on big projects, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to advise you on how to spend your home improvement dollars so that you come away from your sale with the most money possible. Hope to hear from you soon\!
