Our real estate market is as hot as our temperatures, which is to say *it’s on fire*. If you own a home right now, you’re basically swimming a pile of money. Sellers are making ridiculous profits by jumping into the market, and agents are keeping their hands full with new clients who are flooding in and trying to buy and sell homes. **In fact, we just helped our 105th client in 2021, so we’re acutely aware of how crazy the market’s been.**

To give you an idea of what sellers can get today, I’d like to show off a few homes that are what I call “stoopid money properties” (the two oo’s are for emphasis). In Downtown St. George, we listed a home for $499,000, which is already pretty high. Get this: It sold for $550,000 within 24 hours.

Another home in the Red Cliffs area sold for $240,000 in 2016, but it just sold again for $405,000 last month. This was a property that wasn’t really anything spectacular, but the price absolutely skyrocketed in just five years. Finally, a home in Arcadia sold for $660,000 in 2019—guess how much it went for this year? Would you believe it sold for $1.1 million? If that’s not *stoopid money*, I don’t know what is.

**Needless to say, it’s an incredible time to be a homeowner right now.** If you’ve had even the slightest thought of potentially selling your home, now is the moment to strike—especially if it’s one of your investment properties or second homes. And we’d like to help you do so. If you’re ready to jump into the market, or if you have any questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you soon.
