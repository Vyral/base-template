I recently joined Greg Rollett on “Wall Street Today” to talk about my career and some select retirement plans that I offer.

**I began my 25-year career as a personal financial advisor, and eventually graduated to working with small and mid-sized companies by managing their retirement plans.** I work with employees to help install plans and stay in compliance to maximize the protection for the employer and, at the same time, increase the opportunity for their employees to have more when they retire.

I went out and searched for about two years to find a strong retirement plan solution by looking to the past. I found a scenario where a bunch of federal banks got together back in the 1940s with individual pension plans that required record keeping and oversight. They decided to put all their assets into one bucket, hire one administrative firm, one record keeper, and have it all reviewed together. In doing so, they got massive economies of scale.

I went out and found the plan administrative company that put this together over 70 years ago, and that plan has over $6 billion in it. I partnered with them to do the same thing with the 401(k) and 403(b) side of the marketplace. **Then we rolled out our two private label select retirement programs for our for-profit and nonprofit clients.** Basically, our clients adopt the program as their own, take their plan from their individual bucket of money, put it in the collective bucket, and are able to get these massive economies of scale.

If you have any questions for me or want to know how you can work to provide better retirement plan solutions for your company or your employees, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
