This month, I want to give you some advice on making your property manager work for you. How do you do that? **By having them do background checks, give you copies of paychecks, run reference checks, and more.**

It’s amazing to me that I get so few calls every year from other tenants who have left us. This tells me that no one is checking the background of these past tenants of ours. There’s probably a reason for that.

**You gotta make sure your property manager conducts walk-throughs, fills out property conditions forms, and is up on all the rules and regulations of the tenant code.**
