<center><em>Why might buyers in today&rsquo;s market choose to purchase a new construction home? There are actually a number of good reasons to do so.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

There are a few reasons why you should consider purchasing a new construction home in 2018.&nbsp;

The first perk, which is many of my clients’ favorite reason for purchasing new construction, is the modern features these homes offer.&nbsp;

Along with these features, new construction homes also provide the opportunities for buyers to customize the property. Buyers may choose their preference of finishes on features such as flooring, cabinets, countertops, and may even add amenities like a wet bar or grill.&nbsp;

**My favorite reason to purchase new construction is that it provides buyers with the ability to work with the builder’s preferred lender.** These lenders, depending on the community, can offer thousands in savings.

For example, TRI Pointe Homes offers $7,500 towards closing costs or design center upgrades.&nbsp;

Another amazing benefit of purchasing new construction is the peace of mind you get with the builder warranty. With this warranty, along with factory warranties, buyers can rest assured that they will be taken care of if any issue were to arise.&nbsp;

Also, **in today’s low inventory market, new construction purchases provide buyers with an opportunity** to avoid competition. Homes in today’s market are being sold within just a few days and are receiving multiple offers. As a homebuyer, searching for a home in such a competitive environment can be stressful.

With new construction, buyers don’t have to overbid. If you have a home to sell, new construction also presents the chance to time your sale perfectly and move into your new home when it’s most convenient for you. The advantages of a new construction purchase are truly worth considering about in today’s hot market.&nbsp;
