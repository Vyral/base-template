If you are getting ready to sell your home, there are a few critical mistakes you must be careful to avoid during your preparations.

First of all, **make sure any renovation projects you take on will pay off in the end.** If the cost outweighs the benefit, it likely is not worth it.

It is also important to make sure the projects will not end up actually harming your home. Home renovations can backfire if not done properly. For example, I recently encountered a homeowner who tried to install a concrete patio outside of their property without any help from a professional and, as a result, the patio was slanted. This led to water runoff draining toward the home and rotting out the band board, as well as some of the plywood behind the siding.

The lesson to be learned from this is that **you should always make sure you are capable of handling a project before trying to tackle it alone.** Otherwise, it never hurts to have a professional take care of things for you. My team and I are well-connected with local professionals, and would love to provide you with a list of our preferred contractors. So feel free to reach out.

To get the highest return on your investment when preparing to sell, **it is best to avoid huge projects like kitchen remodels, unless the room is extremely dated.** Otherwise, simple upgrades like a fresh coat of paint are often the best way to add value.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
