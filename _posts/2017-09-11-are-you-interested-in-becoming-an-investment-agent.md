One of the primary focuses of the REllis Team is investment real estate. What’s it like being an investment agent, though?

**Being an investment agent means working with individuals whose primary goal is to purchase real estate with the intent of making money**. We have both a residential team and an investment team, and we’re always on the lookout for investment-minded agents to work with us.

On our team, being an investment agent means receiving leads who are looking to invest in real estate—some of which you may never meet. We have clients from all over the country, and I’ve worked with clients all the way from California to New York City. For me, this involves coordinating many investment strategies over the phone.

I also attend local meetups, the most prominent of which is an investment-based referral group called Central Ohio Real Estate Entrepreneurs (or COREE). This group has hundreds of members who meet once a month to network and discuss things like property flipping and commercial lending.

In addition to that, our team has commercial, lead-focused, weekly meetings where we’re passing deals to each other and addressing any problems we’re encountering.

**We’re also very involved with BiggerPockets.com—a website that’s like Facebook for real estate investors.**

We’re on all of these platforms every month and engaging more business-minded clients than residential ones.

We’re always growing and looking for great talent, and there’s always room on our team for people who have a great mindset. I was a finance major at Ohio State, so I’ve always connected with the numbers. I enjoy the challenge that comes with working on the investment side of real estate.

If you have the same mindset and are interested in becoming a full-time investment agent on our team, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to talk with you. <br>
