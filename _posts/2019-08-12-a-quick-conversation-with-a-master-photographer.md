Shawn Stallard from Chaparral Visuals has worked with us on hundreds of homes over the years. I recently caught up with him at the newest Sunwood Homes.

I had a great trip recently out to the Brookwood subdivision to visit one of their models and the photographer who was set to photograph it. It was developed and built by Sunwood Homes.&nbsp;

This place is absolutely epic and Shawn Stallard from Chaparral Visuals talked to us about what he does in his day-to-day process. He’s probably done hundreds of home photography sessions for us and he shoots around 20 homes per week.&nbsp;

Shawn takes anywhere from 60 to 80 pictures of each home and we take the 20 to 30 best ones to put online. Working with a professional photographer is such a luxury. Shawn knows exactly what he needs to do to capture homes in their best light and he does a fantastic job. His background is in architectural photography and he has a keen sense of using light.

If you have any questions for Shawn, give him a call at (435) 321-9016. If you have any real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
