<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are three things you need to consider if you’re planning to sell this year.</em></p>

If you’re planning to sell your home in 2020, keep these three things in mind: you’ll need to prepare your home for the market, be flexible with your showings, and make sure you have at least one full weekend of exposure on the market. Here’s what I mean:

**1\. Prepping your home for sale.** You can’t just throw your home on the market; by spending a little time, energy, and effort in making sure your home looks it’s best, you’ll almost certainly get more money on the back end. We refer our clients to an interior designer who helps them declutter, depersonalize, reconfigure furniture, and ultimately optimize their space for photos and videos.

If you have any small projects or loose ends you need to tie up, do those before you put your home on the market; buyers sometimes have a way of making mountains out of molehills, so it’ll be easier to preempt that by getting such projects done earlier.

**2\. Be flexible with showings.** The easier it is for buyers to view your home, the easier it is for you to sell it. In a perfect world, buyers would give you ample notice before scheduling a showing, but it often doesn’t happen that way in reality. Many buyers can only give a few hour’s notice due to family obligations or work.

**3\. Have at least one full weekend of exposure.** We recommend that our sellers list their homes on Thursday, so they get the whole weekend to allow people to see it and schedule showings. Then, on Monday or Tuesday, we can start presenting offers. We’ll often suggest that our sellers find somewhere to go over the weekend so that we can arrange as many showings as we possibly can.
