Crystal Harris is here today to talk a little more about the loan application process.

Check out the next Agent Mastermind
Apply Online

In our last video, we talked to Evelyn about the beginning of the application process. This time, we’re here with Crystal Harris to dig into the process a little further.

Crystal has been with us for a little over a year, and this is her first job in the mortgage industry. After Evelyn gets applications sent out to clients, Crystal is responsible for helping you through the application process, answering any and every question you have.

After the application is in, she is the one who will follow up with you and request a whole lot of paperwork. **Be prepared for us to ask for a lot of information.** It’s not going to be an easy thing to do to track down everything we need, but it will be worth it. The process is vastly different and more complex than it used to be, but it’s worth it in the end.

After all your questions have been answered and you get your paperwork in, Crystal will make an appointment for you with Kristin where you can go over everything in further detail.

**Most people don’t know what the application process is going to be like** and that’s why Crystal enjoys helping our clients by answering their questions, letting them know what to expect, and calming any fears they have.

If you are interested in getting a loan application started or if you just have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
