<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you or someone you know needs masks or supplies to help fight off the virus, I’d love to provide them to you.</em></p>

After having spoken with some of our clients each week, I learned that many of you have lost your jobs. I’ve never really shared this with anyone before, but years back when I was working in banking, I was suddenly laid off as the result of a merger. **At the time, it felt like the worst day of my life, but it turned out to be the best day** because if that hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have started my real estate business. Banking wasn’t what I was meant to do; I was meant to run a business of my own where I could help people achieve their goals in life. Just know that eventually, the economy is going to recover, your jobs will return, and furloughs will end.

**My team has really hunkered down to adapt our process to these unfamiliar times.** We’ve been working virtually for some time now given the stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures we’ve undertaken.&nbsp;

Speaking of safety measures, I was recently at Price Shopper when I saw an elderly lady shopping without a mask or gloves. As you probably know, we’re mandated to wear masks out in public. Many of my friends who are business owners working with manufacturing companies or retooling are producing goods that can be used to help fight the virus.

We in the real estate industry can’t do that; we’re a service industry. But what can we, as Realtors, do for you? We’re really good networkers.

I was able to source some N-95 masks for those who need them. If you’re a first responder, I will provide them to you free of charge. **All we ask is that you come to pick them up in my office since my team is working virtually and I cannot package them all up on my own.**

And if there’s anything else my team can do for you or someone you know, reach out to us. Nothing would make me happier than to supply you and your family with free masks to help keep you safe and healthy.
