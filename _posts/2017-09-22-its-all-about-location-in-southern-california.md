Why is location so important in Southern California real estate? There are a few things to consider when selecting a new neighborhood you’d like to live in.

Consider **school districts** if you have school age children. There’s a terrific resource, **[GreatSchools.org](GreatSchools.org)**, to find school rankings in any given area. All you need to do is plug in your prospective zip code. It ranks schools from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest a school can possibly score.

What about **views?** Do you see city lights, ocean waves, or mountains from the comfort of your own home? There are tons of properties with attractive views, which will help it appreciate or maintain value over time.

Think about **crime rates.** Heat maps on **[Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/local/)** allow you to access crime rates. You can type in an address or zip code to access the number of incidents, including details about each one. The green areas represent less crime, while warmer colors (orange and red) are those with more crime.

What about **proximity to entertainment arts and nightlife?** In the past few years, we’ve noticed many people wanting to live close to a grocery store, so they can bike there with their reusable bags. Others want to walk to local restaurants.

Check on **traffic concerns.** Will your property be close to a railroad, freeway or a flight path? The only exception is the John Wayne airport flight path. Homes are holding their own, which could be from the restriction that planes can’t fly during the middle of the night.

What about **employment rates?** For instance, if there’s only one top employer in the area, it won’t have a good impact on your future home’s value if they chose to leave.

Pay attention to **hazard proximity.** For instance, is a property close to a nuclear power plant or landfill? That will decrease the value of your home.
