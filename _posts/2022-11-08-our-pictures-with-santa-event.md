It’s the time of giving, and the time to be with your loved ones. We're excited to invite you to our Pictures with Santa event. We had a great time with our friends, family, and clients last year. In fact, we had so many people that we're doubling the size of this space this year. **Our Pictures with Santa event will be on December 1 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Lone Peak Park.**

In addition to pictures with Santa, we'll also have drawings, prizes, and lots of great treats. We really look forward to seeing you there. Bring your ugly sweaters and your Santa hats, and make sure to [click here to register for the event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/463807148667).
