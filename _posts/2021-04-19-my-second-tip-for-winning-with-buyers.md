Today we're going to talk about my second tip for winning with buyers. You should have your lender reach out and talk to the listing agent.

Last week I introduced my first tip for winning with buyers, which was about communicating with the listing agent. Hopefully, you guys have done that and you've written offers over the past week or two. Today we're going to talk about **having your lender reach out and talk to the listing agent.**&nbsp;

Many times I get offers sent to me via email, and then I’m the one who has to track down the lender to have a conversation about their creditworthiness and whether they have a digitally underwritten offer or pre-approval. Honestly, most times I’m not getting a hold of the lender, even after leaving multiple messages.

**You can combat this by simply having your lender reach out directly to the listing agent.** My lender, Mandy, over in *(can’t understand the co. name)* Lending, she will do that. I just have to present the offer we placed and she knows. She will call and let them know everything and anything about that buyer's creditworthiness within the scope that she can. That will help you win offers.

If you're not doing that, I would suggest you create that relationship with your lender today. Make sure they're willing to do that and have them reach out to the listing agent. You're going to find yourself winning offers after putting this tip into practice.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned to my blog next week for my third tip.
