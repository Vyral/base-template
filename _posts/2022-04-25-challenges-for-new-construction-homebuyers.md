Today I have a few quick tips for homebuyers. With this COVID situation, our supply lines are kind of jammed up. Hopefully, we can get things back to where they were.&nbsp;

For the time being, inventory is short, and if you see something good come on the market as a buyer, you have to get at it right away by putting your offer in first. Getting pre-qualified has never been more important.

Building a home is harder than it has been in the last few years, but it’s still a great option if you can afford it. It will take longer to get built, but you can secure a home you love. **You may also end up walking into quite a bit of equity because you’ve already locked in a contract.**&nbsp;

We can certainly help you buy a new construction home. If you have any questions for us about building, buying, or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
