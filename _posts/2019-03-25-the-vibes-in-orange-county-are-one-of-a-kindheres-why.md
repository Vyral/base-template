Living in Orange County is a lifestyle, and it’s one that comes with many options.&nbsp;

Do you enjoy surfing? It may not be my cup of tea, but I can show you some of the best waves in the O.C.

Looking for ocean views? We have those too. Over the last 40 years, I’ve probably seen them all.&nbsp;

Looking for a place to hike? We’ll see you at Peter’s Canyon and Wilderness Park on the weekends.

Do you love food and wine? We boast some of the best of both at Antonello, Vaca, and Pescadou Bistro—an authentic French restaurant on the Balboa Peninsula.&nbsp;

Are you someone who enjoys the arts? Then, why not attend a Broadway show at the performing arts center. If the Symphony is more in line with your tastes, check out the Pacific Symphony or the Pacific Chorale all at the Segerstrom Center.&nbsp;

**We pride ourselves on lifestyle experiences.** My spontaneous nature has allowed me to experience all kinds of O.C. vibes and real estate ventures. I like to be hands-on when working with my clients, and I thrive on solving problems and finding new ways to do things. Fortunately, my experience has allowed me to do a lot of that.&nbsp;

Let me introduce myself: I’m Valerie van de Zilver and I’m a lifestyle Realtor-entrepreneur, and **I help Orange County residents find and enjoy a home that will be congruent to the lifestyle they seek.&nbsp;**

If you’re looking for an agent who’s going to help you live the O.C. lifestyle, please get in touch with me and try O.C. vibes. I’d love to have a conversation with you!
