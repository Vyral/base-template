If you're new to the business of real estate, the first thing you should do is ask yourself where you're going to get business from. Getting new leads is the hardest part of real estate.

A lot of agents ask me what I would do if I was first getting into the business, so I wanted to drop by with some important tips for brand-new agents.

If I was entering the business today, the first thing I would do is **ask myself where I'm going to get business.** If you don't have a ready answer for that, you need to put things on pause and figure it out.

Getting business and leads is the hardest part of this business.

When I first got into the business, I spent the first month and a half in the phone book calling the A's and asking if anyone wanted to buy or sell a house. I didn't sell a house until I got to the B's! It took a month and a half to get a sale because I had no book of business.

If you ask yourself where you're going to get business from and you don't know the answer, I'd highly recommend investigating a team. On our team, **we love new agents because we can teach them.** Old agents tend to come with old habits. New agents who have been in the business for less than a couple of years do great on our team and they sell tons of houses, and we love them.

 Newer agents are able to sell a ton of houses with us because we have a book of business for them. They walk in and they instantly have leadsâ€“which are the hardest thing in this business to get.

 If you have any questions about developing business and getting leads, give me a call. I'd love to talk with you and help you advance your career.
