Selling a home is a long and complicated process. If you aren’t careful, you could be making major mistakes without even knowing it. We wanted to drop by today and talk about some of the most common mistakes we see from sellers in hopes that you don’t make them as well.

**One of the biggest and most common mistakes for home sellers is getting to emotional about the sale.** You’re always going to overvalue your home because of all the memories you’ve made in there and how much work you’ve put into it. However, overpricing your home can lead to it sitting on the market for much longer than it needs to. You should work with your agent to come up with an appropriate price, which will set your expectations at a level place and remove a lot of frustrations for you and your agent.

Another big one is ignoring small flaws throughout the home. Even though you may not have seen or even thought about that little corner of the wall that the dog chewed on, buyers will notice it right away. **You want to make the best first impression possible,** and taking the little bit of time and money necessary to fix those imperfections will go a long way when it comes time to sell.

Excess clutter is another huge no-no. You want to create a blank slate for buyers with minimal furniture and decorations. Decluttering helps buyers envision themselves and their stuff in your home.

<br>Finally, you need to avoid joining ranks with the wrong Realtor. You need someone who is passionate about selling your home, will work hard to get the job done, and have good communication with you throughout the process. **If your Realtor isn’t answering your calls or texts right away, you might want to look for someone new.**
