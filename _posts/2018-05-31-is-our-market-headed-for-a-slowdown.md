Home prices are rising and we’re in a strong seller’s market all across the country. **There are signs that we’re in for a bit of a slowdown, though.**

Over the last six years, home prices have risen. In the last two years, they’ve risen significantly. With that, mortgage rates are starting to rise right alongside them. Right now, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage is up almost a full percentage point compared to where it was in September 2017.

This has put a lot of pressure on the market, and we’re starting to see a lot of first-time homebuyers back out of the market due to both low inventory and low affordability levels.

What’s driving prices right now isn’t the same cause that was driving them during our last real estate boom. During our last boom, the rise in prices was caused by easy money. What’s driving prices now is basic supply and demand—**there are too many buyers and not enough houses.** Compared to the last boom, this is a good thing. We’re seeing lower default rates on mortgages, which is indicative of a stronger, more sustainable market.

The reason many economists are starting to take issue with this market and predict a coming slowdown, though, is **wages aren’t keeping up with rising home prices.** There’s a large gap between these two things, and that’s usually a warning sign of things to come.

When this expected slowdown is going to happen is hard to say, but these experts are in agreement that it will occur in the near future. This means if you’re thinking of putting your home on the market, now’s the time to do it—before things start to take a turn.
