If you’re having trouble pursuing your career goals, there are a couple important questions you need to ask yourself.

First, **what environment are you trying to pursue your career goals in?** Do you have an office where you can meet with clients, make phone calls, and work your database? Do you have a staff at that office that supports you?

Second, **is your work culture conducive to your goals?** Do the people there share the same values as you? You need the kind of environment that will allow you to time block and build the career you want.

What does the Expert Home Advisors work environment look like? Our environment is whatever you need it to be. We give you the space and freedom to go after your goals and the team you need to achieve them. There are 13 people in our office who can offer the kind of coaching, mentoring, accountability, training, support you need. If something isn’t working, we’ll look you in the eye and tell you why. Then, we’ll make a plan to fix what’s wrong.

If you’re on the listing side of the business, we have someone who’s a CEO with an inside sales team to make sure you get face to face. You also have a transaction manager to ensure that if something’s under contract, it’s going to closing. If there’s an issue, they will be there to help you so you don’t have to jump on your email every five seconds. Also, we have weekly impact zones that will inform you what’s happening with any pending business you have.

As we grow people who are like-minded to become expert agents, we add support as they need it. **Success for us means supporting you and your goals and helping you get to where you need to go.**

If you think our environment might be helpful to you and taking the next step in your career, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to chat with you.
