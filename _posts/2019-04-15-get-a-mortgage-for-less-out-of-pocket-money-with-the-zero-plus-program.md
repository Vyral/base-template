Keller Mortgage’s new Zero Plus Program is here, and we’re going to tell you all about it today. So what is the Zero Plus Program? An alternative to traditional mortgages, Keller Mortgage’s Zero Plus Program allows buyers to secure a mortgage without origination fees or lender fees. A recent client of ours saved $4,200 using this Program instead of a traditional mortgage package. If you’d like to learn more, feel free to give us a call or visit [www.kellermortgage.com](https://kellermortgage.com/){: target="_blank"}. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
