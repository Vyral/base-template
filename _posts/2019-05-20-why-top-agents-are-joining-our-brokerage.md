Today we’re doing another agent spotlight, and this time I’m joined by Matt Zielinski. Matt has been selling real estate in our area for about 15 years, and he joined Corner House Realty about six months ago because he believed in what we were doing. We’re community-centric and customer-oriented, and these are the same principles Matt abides by. Under this philosophy, it’s easier for our brokers to distinguish themselves and help local buyers and sellers. If you’re looking for an agent in the Howard County, Carroll County, or Catonsville area, you won’t find a better combination of experience and customer service than Matt.

If you have any questions or would like to get in contact with Matt, give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.
