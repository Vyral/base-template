Don’t be fooled by common misconceptions; fall is a better time to sell your home than the spring.

Many people believe that spring is a better time to put their home on the market. Today, I'm here to tell you why this isn't the case.

The main reason to sell now rather than wait until spring is **you’ll have more competition in the spring than you would in the fall.**

It’s true that there are typically more buyers out in the spring, but the thing about fall buyers is that **they’re more serious and more motivated to buy your house.** No one really wants to buy a house during the holidays, so the ones that are looking at houses now are going to be more motivated going into closing. That can also mean a faster sale and a higher price.

The other good thing about listing in the fall is that the grass is still pretty green, and we have beautiful autumn colors, so **it’s a great time to take pictures of your home to highlight its positive qualities.** If you wait until winter, you’ll find that everything is kind of dreary and brown—not a pretty backdrop for any photography. You’d then have to wait further into spring to list your house, when you could be missing a good portion of the spring market.

If you’re going to take your pictures now and get your house ready for the market, you’re probably going to experience a better selling situation.

If you have any questions about preparing your home for the fall market, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I would be happy to help you!
