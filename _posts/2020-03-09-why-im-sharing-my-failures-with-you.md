Today we’re talking about failures. What a lovely topic, right? I actually used to do a “Fail Forward Friday” series where I would share my failures and I think it was a great way to share with other agents that failure is actually just feedback. **I think I stopped doing it because I didn’t want to dwell on my failures.** However, I just heard a quote that changed my mind: “Success is just failure with enthusiasm.”

What I have noticed is that even though I look like I’m good at using leverage, it is something I’m really not great at.&nbsp;

I will find myself spending lots of focused time getting into the details of activities, especially when it comes to our database and administrative tasks. **I like those things and am good at those things, but I often find that doing them uses up a lot of quality time that could have been used more efficiently in talking with people and finding people to help.&nbsp;**

I have a team, I have agents on my team, and I have administrative rockstars, but I don’t always properly leverage them. **The good thing is that I have awareness about this problem, which is something that all successful people have.** Those who are working and committing to self mastery, like myself, know they must learn how to leverage through people.

That’s my failure and I’m sharing it with you here because the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. **I want to hear about your failures, too, so that we can all grow together.**

If you have any other questions for me, I’m always here to answer them. Just give me a call or send me an email today.
