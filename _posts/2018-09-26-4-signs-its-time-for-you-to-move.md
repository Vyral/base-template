A statement we hear from homeowners often goes like this: “I’d like to do something in the future, but I just don’t know if the timing is right for me.” **Here are four signs that it is time for you to consider making that move.**

**1. Your home is too small.** This one seems obvious, right? If the home that worked great for you with small babies and toddlers feels like it’s bursting at the seems as they grow into pre-teens and teenagers, it’s time to check out the options that might be a fit for you. You’d be surprised at how easy it is to transition into a space that makes much more sense to you.

**2. Your lifestyle has changed**. An area that makes sense at one point in your life might create a really difficult commute when your work changes or you retire. The home that served you really well until this point might not really be the fit. The good news is that there are really good options out there that will give you the lifestyle you want for today.

**3. Remodeling isn’t enough.** When remodeling the home simply doesn’t give you the return you need to alter the space, it might be time to go find a different place. I see this happen quite a bit. We get really attached to our homes, especially if we’re comfortable there and have been there for a long time. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to remodel because you’ll end up over-improving for the neighborhood or over-leveraging yourself on the house. We have access to many studies that give information about what kind of returns different improvements will give you. If you’re curious about that when weighing the pros and cons, we’d be happy to pass that information along.

**4. You have some flexibility in your timeline.** I know this might seem a little strange, but the thing is that in 2018 we have a great market. I’ve been in real estate for 19 years and have seen some markets that are really rough. In these markets, someone may have wanted to make a change because of one these reasons, but values had declined so much that they were stuck and couldn’t make a move until the market improved. If you know what you want for your future and know something different is what you need, explore the market right now while the market is great and there are a lot of different advantages to being a seller.

As always, if you have any questions for me or you’re interested in buying or selling a home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
