We all want to shoot for perfection: an 850 credit score is the best score you can get. Although it may seem out of reach, many people do obtain it. Careful budgeting and detailed attention to every aspect of their financial picture are umbrella tactics they use to achieve and maintain that score—and you should, too.

If 850 is out of reach within a reasonable time frame for you to purchase your home, shoot for 750 instead. This is the magic number that many creditors and lenders are looking for. In order to eventually reach 850, here are a few tips that will help you on the way:

**1. Set up automatic payments.** According to CreditCards.com, 35% of your credit score is taken from the history of your payments. You may have missed some payments in the past, and that’s something you’ll have to contend with. Remember: Almost every creditor will give you the option of automatic payment, and this is the easiest way to be sure you’ll never miss a payment.

**2. Don’t be afraid of refinancing.** You might end up buying a home before your credit score is where you want it to be, especially if you bought your home with the FHA loan; their streamlined refinance programs can potentially lower your rate without any appraisal, credit check, or job verifications.

While it may seem like having a credit balance of zero would indicate you’re financially savvy, banks like to see responsible credit management; that means using your credit cards and paying them down to a reasonable amount every month.
