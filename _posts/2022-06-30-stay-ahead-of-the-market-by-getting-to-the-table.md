If you’ve been checking out my recent blog posts, you know that I’ve been running through the different tactics outlined in “Shift” by Gary Keller. This book is all about how to not only survive but thrive in a changing market, and each week, this series becomes more relevant. Our market is shifting rapidly, so converting your leads is more important than ever. To help you do this, let’s discuss shift tactic No. 5, getting to the table.&nbsp;

Why does getting to the table matter so much in a shift? You’ll probably find fewer leads because there aren’t as many in our slowing market. That means you have to convert as many leads as possible to make up for the loss.&nbsp;

**Getting to the table comes down to three steps:** capturing the lead, connecting with the lead, and either cultivating the lead or closing on an appointment.&nbsp;

Capturing the lead is all about getting enough information so you can contact somebody. This all starts with scripts and a quality system. After capturing, ask them standard questions to keep the conversation going and build rapport. Once you feel comfortable closing, try one of the nine classic closes. I won’t go over them in detail right now since that’s a topic for another blog post, but they are on the screen in my video at 2:24 if you want to take a look at them.&nbsp;

If your lead isn’t planning on selling or buying right now, **you need to cultivate them with a stay-in-touch program.** For example, my team uses an eight-by-eight program to cement relationships, which means we contact them eight times over eight weeks. After that, we try to contact all our leads at least 32 times a year. This is the glue that takes you from cultivating to closing.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this shift tactic or anything else, please call or email me. I’d love to hear from you\!
