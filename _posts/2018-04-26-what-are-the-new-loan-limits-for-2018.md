Each year, the Housing and Recovery Act requires that the baseline conforming loan limit be adjusted to reflect the sales price of the previous year.&nbsp;

This year, **the conforming loan limit rose to $453,100. The VA and USDA limits also rose to this amount.** For our local area, the base FHA loan limit rose to $294,515.&nbsp;

These loan limit increases help programs to stay up-to-date in relation to current sales prices in our market.&nbsp;
