Reaching your Clients through Video

A lot of people ask us, "Why video?" when they find out how we market ourselves to our past, present and future clients. Well, it just so happens that the 2nd most used search engine in the world is a video site. That's right, we are talking about YouTube. Everybody has got a smart phone now and people like video. Being able to show a house through video can show the property in a much better light than pictures can. With video, you are positioning yourself **where the consumer is and where they are looking.** Not all video is helpful, however. Consumers enjoy watching videos and TV shows about homes and home improvements, but the information they get from those shows is inaccurate and wrong.

When we do videos with our marketing partner, Vyral Marketing, **we are giving out short, educational videos that add value and give information about current events to our clients.** Are they going to watch these types of videos every day? No, but when they are thinking of buying or selling, they are going to find these videos. The real point of the videos is to get the message across to the consumer as they are looking, **so you can position yourself as an expert in the area.**

If you have any questions about how to insert video in your marketing, please give us a call. We'd love to answer any and all questions you might have.
