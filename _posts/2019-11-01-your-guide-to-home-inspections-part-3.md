What do home inspectors look for when they inspect a house? In part three of my “All Things Home Inspection” series, I’m joined once again by Michael Amendola of All Points Inspections so he can answer that question. He’ll also share his own unique approach to inspecting a house as we walk through my own home, take you through the process step by step, and point out various red flags that are commonly searched for.&nbsp;
