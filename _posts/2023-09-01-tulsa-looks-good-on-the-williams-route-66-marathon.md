Jennie caught up with Executive Director, Destiny Green to hear what to expect for the run on the Mother of all Roads! The Williams Route 66 Marathon showcases the best of what Tulsa has to offer!

Start your race in downtown Tulsa, home of the largest concentration of Art Deco architecture, outside of Miami, and then make your way through Tulsa’s vibrant and diverse neighborhoods and the campus of Tulsa University. The Williams Route 66 Marathon is a USATF certified course and a Boston Qualifier

The Williams Route 66 Marathon provides a number of options for whatever level you’re at. Not ready to run a full marathon…that’s ok! The 5K run/walk takes participants on a 3.1 tour of Tulsa’s artistic and hip Tulsa Arts, Blue Dome, Pearl District and through downtown Tulsa.

You can also bring the entire family out to participate in the 1 mile Fun Run/Walk. This untimed event is perfect for the whole family and is stroller-friendly, so bring the kids! After your race, stick around and cheer on participants in the Mascot Dash or get brunch at one of the many local restaurants in the area!

In addition, Kicks for Kids is the Williams Route 66 Marathon’s very own charity, with the mission of encouraging health and wellness in disadvantaged Tulsa youth. Just what is Kicks for Kids? The program pairs Williams Route 66 Marathon race directors with local Title I Elementary Schools to help kids complete their first 5k at the Williams Route 66 Marathon race weekend! Participants in the program will be coached using Fleet Feet Tulsa - Broken Arrow’s Zoomerangs training program for kids and will receive a free t-shirt, finisher medal for the 5k, and the mentorship of a Williams Route 66 Marathon race director. The best part? The marathon is covering the 5k registration fee for every student participant!
