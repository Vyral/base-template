Why can’t you get traditional financing if you want to buy a bank-owned REO property?

**Institutional lenders have very strict underwriting guidelines**, and they have a four-point inspection that any bank-owned property would have to pass wherein each of the following points would have to function properly and be up to code:

1. The HVAC System
2. The electrical systems and electrical panel
3. The plumbing and fixtures
4. The roof

**Oftentimes, homes coming through foreclosure have been subject to what I call “duct tape maintenance.”** They’ve gone through many years of decline because whenever something broke and the owner was having financial problems, they used duct tape maintenance because they didn’t have the money to get it repaired properly. Because of this, these properties will fail one—if not all—of the criteria in the four-point inspection.&nbsp;

Occasionally, I’ll see some of these listings that say they accept cash or conventional financing. Here’s the problem, though: **If you put in an offer on one of those listings with a financing contingency,** **it will go right to the bottom of the offer pile** because that home likely has other cash buyers interested in it who can close much more quickly. By the time you’d be able to get that contingency satisfied, that property will be long gone.&nbsp;

There are some exceptions. FHA offers a 203(k) loan that provides for the purchase and repairs of the home, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get that finished, and I rarely see those examples make it to closing because, again, you get beat out by people who have cash offer who can move quickly and don’t have any contingencies.&nbsp;

Private money lenders will also lend on these properties, but that’s a subject I’ll talk more about after the first of the year.&nbsp;

In the meantime, if you have any other questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
