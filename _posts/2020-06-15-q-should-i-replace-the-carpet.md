If you have carpet in your rental property, it may be time to replace it.

I get asked all the time by rental owners if they should replace the carpet in their properties with wood, vinyl, or tile. My answer to these questions is always yes.&nbsp;

**Carpet has gone out of style over the last decade.** Many tenants with children ask if we have houses available without carpet because they can’t be sure of what kind of care was taken with the carpet before they moved into the house. Also, children will usually be much harder on carpet than adults. A lot of owners will have damage or wear and tear, and the average life of carpet is two to three tenants.&nbsp;

Today many floor products are being made harder, water-resistant, or waterproof. I believe vinyl is the best flooring for rental properties; it has the most variation, a 25-year warranty, and it’s often waterproof. You can have a huge water spill in your house and have no damage or wood issues like bowing of the edges. **Tile is also great, but it’s very expensive to lay,** though it has a shelf life of about 50 years.&nbsp;

My recommendation is to switch to waterproof vinyl if it’s time to change the flooring in your house. There are many products out there, so you can choose what’s best for your property.&nbsp;
