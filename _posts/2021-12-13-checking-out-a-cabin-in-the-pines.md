I’m coming to you today from just outside Boise. A client and I are checking out a beautiful cabin in the pines of Donnelly, Idaho. It has an amazing deck that looks out over the lake and the cabin’s private beach. The video doesn't do it justice.

**I work up in this area as well if you’re looking for a vacation property or rental.** It’s a great place for Airbnbs or just to get away from the hustle and bustle of life.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy or sell or want more information about places like this, give me a call at (208) 919-2424. I look forward to talking to you.
