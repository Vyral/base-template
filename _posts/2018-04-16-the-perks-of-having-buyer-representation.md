There are three important reasons why it’s great to have your own buyer representation when purchasing a home.

**1. No discounts.** You don’t get any discounts by going directly to the listing agent. In fact, that commission is negotiated between the seller and the listing agent.&nbsp;

**2. Agent works for seller.** By not using your own agent, in effect, you are using their agent, and they’ll get paid double.

Think about this: Most people hire someone they know to help them sell their house. Around 65% of the listings are taken either from a referral or a previously known agent. If an agent already knows you they’ll likely have your best interests at heart.

**3. Unbiased advice.** On the buyer side, the agent is truly going to give you unbiased advice. They don’t care which house you buy, which means they can give you honest opinions about what would be the best choice for you.
