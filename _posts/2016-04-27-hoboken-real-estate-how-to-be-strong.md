Today’s topic is all about how to be a strong buyer in a seller’s market. There is so much information out there, it’s hard to know where to start.

First, let’s talk about what we mean when we say “seller’s market.” It means that we have a much larger volume of buyers in our market than the number of homes that are for sale. **Right now, we have 5-7 buyers for every properly priced home.** Where do you start if you’re a buyer? We’ve got a few steps for you to follow today to make things simpler.

**1. Identify the area where you’re searching.**
 Some of these towns are really close together but the taxes, school districts, and transportation methods are all going to be a little different.

**2. Find a great real estate professional.**
Ask friends or family members for references, but make sure those references check out. Look them up online, read customer reviews, and make sure they will be able to get the job done.

**3. Ask the agent for a buyer consultation.**
If you’d like a copy of ours, we’d love to send it out to you. If your agent doesn’t have one or doesn’t even know what it is, it’s time to find another agent. There are plenty of them out there.

**Once you’ve gone through your buyer consultation, you’ll know where you want to live,** what the home prices are like there, what you can afford, the real estate contract and all the contingencies involved, and the timeline for you to purchase a home.

If you have any questions for us, or would like a buyer consultation, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!
