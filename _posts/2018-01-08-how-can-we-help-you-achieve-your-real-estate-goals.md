The real estate landscape in Central Iowa is changing. Never before have there been so many people looking for opportunities in this area.

If you are planning on buying or selling a home in Central Iowa, my team and I are here to help.

I have been in real estate since 1999. From that time, I’ve grown from an individual agent to a broker owner, and now I’m launching The Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate brand here in Iowa. **Better Homes and Gardens allows us to provide a big-time network and small town business values.**

That’s why we’ve been able to sell over $250 million in real estate. As one of the top selling teams in Iowa, we sell one home every 30 hours on average.

We will work to showcase your home in the best way possible. For more details, check out the video above to learn more about our team, our track record, and our marketing strategies. You will also hear from some of our past clients, as they describe their experiences working with our team.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions. My team and I would be happy to help you!
