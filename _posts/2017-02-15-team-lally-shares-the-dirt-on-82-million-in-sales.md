Today we want to talk to you about a career in real estate.

Everyone’s perception of real estate is what they see on those reality shows. Well, here’s the reality about reality TV—it’s not real!

That’s why we want to give you a peek behind the curtain into the real real estate career. We’re everyday people providing exceptional levels of service, and we’re looking for superstars to join us. How do we do that? With a career night, which will be held on March 6th, 2017.

**Please RSVP here:&nbsp;[https://www.teamlally.com/career-night.php](https://www.teamlally.com/career-night.php)&nbsp;to save a seat, because we do fill up.**

Some of the things you will learn include: - The first three steps to becoming a successful Realtor. - The two critical mistakes brand-new Realtors make.

We’ll also answer any questions you may have. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re looking forward to meeting you there in person. Thanks and aloha!
