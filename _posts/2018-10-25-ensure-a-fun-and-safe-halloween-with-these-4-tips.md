**Here are four tips that will help you and your family have a fun, safe Halloween:**

**1.** If you’re a homeowner expecting trick-or-treaters, clear your sidewalks and front yard of all debris and keep everything brightly lit. Also, make sure you use LED candles instead of real candles inside your Jack-o’-lanterns.

**2.** If you’re a parent with young children who plan on trick-or-treating, **make sure you accompany them to every front door they visit.** Also, always use crosswalks instead of running across the street, and remember to tell your children to never enter a stranger’s home.

**3.** If you’re going to be driving on Halloween night, drive slowly, stay off your cell phone, watch out for children crossing the street, and be extra careful when you’re near an intersection or a street corner.

**4.** Make sure your candy is safe to eat. Watch out for any treats with an unusual or discolored appearance, any unwrapped items, or any items whose wrappers have a tear or a hole in them. As a general rule of thumb: **When in doubt, throw it out.**
