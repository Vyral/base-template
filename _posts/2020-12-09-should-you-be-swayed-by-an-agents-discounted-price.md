<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why commission fees shouldn’t determine which agent you work with.</em></p>

Should commission fees be the main determinant of which agent you choose to work with? Think of it this way: If you can out-negotiate the person you’re hiring to negotiate the biggest asset you own, should you work with them? What kind of service can you expect at a discounted price? Will they bring you discounted buyers, as well? **If an agent is willing to give away*****their*** **money, imagine what they’ll do with yours.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
