What are the seven habits of highly effective homebuyers? If you’re ready to enter the market and start looking for your new home, here are some great tips to get you started:

**1. Get pre-qualified.** Be ready to buy as soon as you find the right home. Sellers are going to want to see a pre-qualification letter to know that you are truly capable of purchasing the property. You should become pre-qualified before even beginning your search.

**2. Define your “must-haves,” your “like-to-haves,” and your “don’t-wants.”** At our buyer’s consultation, my team and I will go over these things with you. It’s important to determine what you’re really looking for in a home. Once you do, you can break down those desires into the categories I mentioned earlier.

**3. Be realistic.** Today’s market is short on inventory. With that being the case, buyers simply won’t be able to lowball sellers.

**4. Be open and flexible.** As a buyer, you won’t always get everything you want. It’s certainly good to focus on what you want and don’t want from a property during your search, but try not to expect the perfect house. Remember that you can always change things after you move in. Don’t get caught up in trying to find a home that’s already perfect.

**5. Understand the home buying process.** Our team wants to help you understand what you can expect. When you meet with us for a consultation, we will walk you through every step.

**6. Be responsible and maintain your credit.** I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had issues with buyers paying off some major debt right before closing. It might sound counterintuitive, but paying off a loan or a credit card right before you close can actually sink your credit. Also, hold off any major purchases until after closing.

**7. Have fun with the process.**My entire team and I truly want you to have the best home buying experience possible. If you let us help, we will make sure the process is as smooth and as enjoyable as it can be.
