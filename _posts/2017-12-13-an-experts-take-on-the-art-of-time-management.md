Fellow KW agent and associate broker Julie Hopkins uses specific time management techniques to perform at a very high level in our industry, and there are a few tips she recommends to help you prioritize your business.

A lot of times, Julie notes, agents don’t have control of their own days, but **the most important thing for her is holding a deal together.** “You’ve gone through all the steps to get the deal, and you want to hold it together and get it across the finish line,” she says.

To get a deal across the finish line, the first thing Julie does when she wakes up in the morning is look at what she has under contract and what needs to be done to get that contract to the next step. Her next priority is wherever her next deal is and what can she do in terms of marketing, prospecting, etc., to find the next piece of business.

Real estate agents have to deal with a lot of noise, and there are a lot of people knocking on our door asking for things. For Julie, that’s a difficult thing to manage, but it must be done, and she does it at times that are convenient for her. Some of it she doesn’t respond to, and some of it she does decide to politely respond to. As her email inbox fills up, she makes a conscious choice to stay on task, and that’s what you have to do.

**Julie’s business coach also helps her stay accountable** by asking her important questions about things like her business plan, as well as by talking her through tricky situations and figuring out how to solve them.

“He puts some perspective on things that help me better manage situations.”

Julie also uses the book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” as an important resource. It has helped her realize she’s not an effective multitasker, and she’s much better off at picking one task and focusing all of her attention on that.

**“I have to remember what Stephen Covey said—first things first.”**
