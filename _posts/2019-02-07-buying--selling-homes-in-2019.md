If you’re on the fence about buying or selling a home in 2019, we’d like to share with you a few of our predictions for how the market may play out this year.

Many believe that winter isn’t a good time to buy or sell, but this is simply not the case—our market sees great numbers throughout the year. **We are experiencing some slowdown,** but this is typical as real estate carries on through its up-and-down cycle. We’re definitely not expecting anything like 2008’s market crash; we’re simply returning to a more balanced market.

Though interest rates are currently below 5%, **they rose throughout 2018 and are expected to continue their upward trajectory throughout 2019.** It’s a very good idea to think about listing your home now so you’ll avoid looming rate hikes and be on the market before the spring selling frenzy arrives in March.

Though you’ll have the benefit of experiencing less competition, **you still need to maintain the condition of your home.** Buyers want updated homes so make sure your property is ready for the market before you list.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, email [Info@CallUrsula.com](mailto:Info@CallUrsula.com){: target="_blank"} for a free consultation—we’ll help you understand what needs to be done.
