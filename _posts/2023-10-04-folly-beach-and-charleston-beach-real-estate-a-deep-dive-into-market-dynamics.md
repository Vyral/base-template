What's happening with Folly Beach sales and some of the other Charleston Beach real estate markets? Let's dive into it today.&nbsp;

Starting with Folly Beach, there's currently a significant amount of inventory available. **Homeowners on Folly Beach made an interesting decision in January of this year when they voted to implement a cap on short-term rentals.** Short-term rentals are defined as any properties rented for less than 30 days. To engage in short-term rentals, homeowners must apply for a business license for their property. However, those applying for these licenses, who are also homeowners on Folly Beach, are now placed on a waitlist until the total number of short-term rentals falls below a certain threshold.

This policy change has had a noticeable impact on home sales. Many individuals purchase properties on Folly Beach with the intention of using them for personal use and renting them out as short-term rentals. Consequently, the number of closed sales on Folly Beach this year has seen a significant decline, down by 70% when compared to the previous year.

Now, let's turn our attention to other Charleston Beach areas, such as Isle of Palms. **Home sales on Isle of Palms have also decreased, with a decline of approximately 33%.** Kiawah Island is experiencing a similar trend, with a 25% drop in home sales. The average decrease in closings throughout Charleston County stands at 22% for this year. Isle of Palms and Kiawah Island are aligned with these figures. However, there is a notable exception: Sullivan's Island, which has historically limited short-term rentals, is bucking the trend. Sullivan's Island has actually seen a 20% increase in closed sales between last year and this year.&nbsp;

The question arises: does limiting short-term rentals genuinely affect property values? It appears that in the short term, it does have a substantial impact. Take Sullivan's Island as an example, where property values have increased along with the number of closings, despite the restrictions on short-term rentals.

As for the future of Folly Beach, it remains uncertain at this point. Real estate is unpredictable over the long term, and none of us possess a crystal ball. Nevertheless, it's intriguing to observe the varying trends in different beach areas.&nbsp;
