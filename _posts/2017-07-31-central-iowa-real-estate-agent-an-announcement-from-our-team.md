We have an exciting announcement to make today. It’s going to change the future of our company for the better.

**Want to sell your Central Iowa home?** <a href="http://www.centraliahomevalues.com/" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a>
**Want to buy a Central Iowa home?** <a href="http://mistysold.searchcentraliowahomes.com/" target="_blank">Search all the homes on the MLS</a>

We are excited to announce that as of August 2, 2017, **we have joined forces with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate to form Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations.**

It’s a huge honor to be welcomed into the fold at Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate as a broker/owner. In fact, I’m the only broker/owner of this company in Iowa. This company has a rich history around here. **The publisher of the magazine is actually rooted in Des Moines.**

I’m so pleased that we will have this marketing and media powerhouse behind us 100% to enhance the experiences of our clients and agents. We are now aligned with a brand that is not only relevant to the people we serve but also has relevant information available for them 365 days a year.

You’ll start seeing green Better Homes and Gardens signs up with our team’s name on the side here shortly. **Keep an eye out for them.**

If you or anyone you know is thinking about buying, selling, or investing in real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
