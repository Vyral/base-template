It’s time for an update on our current real estate market.&nbsp;

Things are getting a little intense out there. We’ve seen issues arise for a few of our buyers including unexpected damages. Unforeseen expenses can ruin deals, so if you’re entering our market any time in the near future, be cautious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, it’s important to realize that some properties in our market are selling quickly and some aren’t. **If****&nbsp;you’ve been trying to sell for the past couple of years but haven’t been successful yet, give my team a call. We would be happy to help.**&nbsp;

Something else to be aware of is that in most areas of our market, we’re seeing a shortage of inventory. This is good news for sellers. Even though the market has improved, it’s still a bad idea to overprice your home.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can help you achieve your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
