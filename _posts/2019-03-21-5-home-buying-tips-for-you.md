If you’re in the market to buy a home anytime in the near future, **I’ve got some great tips that will help you have a great experience:**

**1. Hire a real estate professional.** I’ve been in the market for 30 years and things are always changing. Hiring a professional is important to keep you up to date with these changes and to have experience in dealing with issues that may come up during the process.

**2. Know your price.** Before you go out looking for a home, you need to know how much you can afford. This means that you’ll need to talk with a lender and get a pre-approval to know exactly what you can afford.

**3. Find some perspective of where you want to be.** Drive through some neighborhoods that are in the areas where you’re looking to move to in order to get a better idea of where you want to buy.

**4. Know your preferences (wants vs. needs).** Figure out what you need to have in a home and what you’d just like to have. How many bedrooms do you need? What kind of garage do you need? It’s important to make a distinction between the two.

**5. Put it all in play and find your perfect home.** You should be comfortable and knowledgeable about the market and what to expect in this area. Even if you’ve bought a home in the past, it’s important to know what’s going on in the Clarksville market right now.
