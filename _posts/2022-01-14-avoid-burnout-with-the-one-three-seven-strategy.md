Are you ready for some reality? This business can eat you up. It’s true; I’m speaking from experience. If you allow it, real estate can be a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year job. I know – because I did it\!

Instead, take control of your time and calendar and make sure you block out important you-time and family-time. A great trick I use is the 1-3-7. This means **you should take purposeful time off at least one day a week, have a three-day weekend once a month, and take a seven-day vacation once a quarter.** This also includes a wellness Wednesday. This means each week, you’ll have a midweek reset. It can be anything: a massage, exercise, getting your hair done – Whatever you need to finish your week strong\!

Some of this may sound extreme and a little far-fetched. You may need to start small to work your way into this type of thinking. However, you’d be surprised how things happen when you write things down, put them in your calendar, and share them with others.&nbsp;**Start implementing the 1-3-7 method into your schedule – you and your loved ones will love it\!**

As always, call or email me with any questions you have. Let me know how the 1-3-7 is working for you. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;
