<center>If you&rsquo;re thinking of building your dream home, Valhalla Country Estates is a great place to do it.</center>

&nbsp;

Now that we’re into January, I want to wish you a belated happy New Year and to express my excitement about what we have in the works in 2020. Today I’m on-site at Valhalla Country Estates, a new home development in Middleton, and there are many half-acre lots available here for excellent prices. The space between these homes is something you don’t see in many other developments, and it’s only a 10-minute drive from Eagle. Most of these homes will be between 2,500 and 3,000 square feet, and there are many RV garages too. I’m representing Ironstone Builders in this subdivision, so if you’re thinking of buying a new construction home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you custom design the home you’ve always wanted.&nbsp;
