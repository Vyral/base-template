It’s that time of year when people start getting into the holiday spirit. In fact, an unnamed member of my household was recently blaring Christmas music on October 1. However, this got me thinking about the holidays and our upcoming event.

Your schedules are probably already filling up over the next few months, **so I wanted to take a moment today to extend a personal invite to join us at our third annual holiday pie event on November 15.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

**Come get your free, fresh-baked apple or pumpkin pie at Towne Lake Hills Club House (1003 Towne Lake Hills E.) from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.** In addition to the pies, we'll also have Santa, Mrs. Claus, and professional photographer John Humphrey. We’ll also have food and live music\!

**To reserve your pie and RSVP to the event, give us a call today or send an email over to [pies@callursula.com](mailto:pies@callursula.com) to let us know if your family can make it and what kind of pie you’d like.** &nbsp;If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
