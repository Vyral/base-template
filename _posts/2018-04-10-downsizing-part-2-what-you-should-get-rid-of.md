Today we’re going to continue our discussion on downsizing. Last time we talked about what you should keep, so the focus today is on what you should get rid of. It’s not so quite cut and dry.

**First, find your absolutes.**The things that you’re keeping no matter what. An heirloom, a gift, or an expensive piece of technology or clothing. &nbsp;

**Now you have to figure out what you need to get rid of.** For starters, go back to my old philosophy of “If you haven’t used it in the last year and you won’t use it in the next year, get rid of it. “ A donation to a charity is going to pay you far better dividends on taxes than selling it. Let’s face it, we all have close that we say we’re going to fit into again, but most of us are lying to ourselves. Get rid of those old clothes.

I highly encourage you to donate any and all of your usable goods. **You’ll be able to do something good for someone else while also getting some tax benefits in the process.**

If you have any other questions about what you need to get rid of before selling your home, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
