Today, we’ll talk about how to approach a company that has a negative reputation both from the candidate’s and client’s perspective.

If you are a candidate looking at a company that has a tougher reputation in the market, the first thing we recommend is working with a recruiter. Talk to your recruiter and call out the elephant in the room. Have a very direct conversation with the recruiter. Talk about some of the things you’ve heard in the marketplace or through your colleagues. In general, it’s always best to get that insight on your own.

As a hiring authority, if a candidate comes in and asks about something that they’ve heard in the marketplace, it’s a great chance for you to clear the air about your organization. If your past has not been great and you’ve made some changes to your organization, **hit it on the head and describe the changes you’ve made to make the candidate feel comfortable.**

If you are in a situation where the company faces challenges moving forward, there are a lot of opportunities that lay in those situations. When you’re able to identify them and bring your skill set to that team or company, it’s a great place for you to shine as a candidate. These can be great opportunities for your career and give you the building blocks for a success story.

As a hiring authority, it’s important to keep in mind that businesses are run by people. The reputations of those businesses depend on the reputation of those people. This is a great opportunity for you to bring in some of the top talents out there. Bring in the players who can change that reputation, and make sure that potential candidates meet standards to help turn the reputation around.

**As a candidate, remember to take everything with a grain of salt.&nbsp;**There are so many different channels of information, and you have to be able to decipher all of that on your own. There are a lot of different avenues you can pursue to learn more about a company, such as looking at social media. There is a lot of information that you can secure on your own, so make sure that you do your homework and make your own assessment of that company.

Finally, as an organization, you have to be proactive. Make sure potential candidates are able to review your organization by having a company Facebook page, LinkedIn profile, and GlassDoor page. Have testimonials from clients, customers, and employees. Your employee testimonials should describe what a day in the life looks like for this organization.
