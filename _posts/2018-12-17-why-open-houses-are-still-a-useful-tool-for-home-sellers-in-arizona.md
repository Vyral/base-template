Are open houses a good way to get your home sold?

According to the National Association of Realtors, approximately 0.78% of all annual home sales occur because of an open house. That’s better than 0%, but that’s still not a very big number.

Here in Arizona, though, open houses are a more productive tool for getting your home sold because there are many Snowbelt residents who only live here during the winter and actively look for available houses for their friends back home. This means from December all the way until March or even April, you can hold an open house any day of the week and get a steady stream of snowbird visitors.

Oftentimes, after when we meet with these people at an open house, we’ll start communicating with one of their Snowbelt friends and sending them information about available listings. Once they get a chance to come down here, we start showing them homes.
