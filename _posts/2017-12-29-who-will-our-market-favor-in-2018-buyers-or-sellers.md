When looking at our upcoming 2018 market, most people will notice that money is cheap, which means it’s a good time to buy. They’ll also notice that inventory is low, which means there are lots of buyers out there and it’s also a great time to sell.&nbsp;

**For the majority of people, 2018 will be a seller’s market.** However, this can depend on who’s marketing your home and how that house is marketed. We had a meeting the other day with a couple selling their home who ended up deciding to do business with a friend. At the end of the meeting, they apologized for having us over because they were going to go with their friend regardless. They felt bad for wasting our time, but we told them it was okay and to let us know if things didn’t work out.&nbsp;

What happened with their listing? It’s been on the market for a little over two months, and our office—which has sold over 250 homes in this area—hasn’t received a single email or phone call notifying us that this property was on the market.

For that couple, are we still in a seller’s market? **Just because homes are selling fairly quickly doesn’t mean your home doesn’t need to be marketed.** There are a ton of buyers out there, but if the agents in our area don’t know about your home, buyers might never find it. This couple eventually reached out to us and asked us to market their home, so from now on, all 12,000 people in our area will know about their home.&nbsp;

On the flip side, we’re going to argue that for our buyers—or the folks who work with Carolina Real Estate Experts—it’s a buyer’s market. This is because **we focus on getting our buyers priority access to all the better deals out there the second they come on the market** so they avoid entering multiple offer situations with other buyers.&nbsp;

In that case, our buyers are in a buyer’s market and our sellers are in a seller’s market.&nbsp;

No matter which side of the fence you’re on, we’d love to help you. If you have any questions about our market or any real estate topics you’d like us to address, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you.
