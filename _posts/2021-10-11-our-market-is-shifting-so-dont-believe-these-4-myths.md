We’ve all read the news, seen the headlines, and maybe even heard it from our friends. The market has been crazy with stories of houses selling in minutes and way over list price. Some of those actually did happen, but the market is shifting, and, as a seller, you need to adjust to the slightly slower pace. Realtor.com just released an article about four things that aren’t true about our market anymore but are still being talked about like they are.
