If you are selling your home, hosting an open house will be a very important step in achieving listing success.

Why is this the case? Well, three of the last four listings my team dealt with sold as a direct result of having an open house. **There are a lot of misconceptions out there about open houses, but they are much more valuable than many make them out to be.**

Before I get into why open houses are so effective, I would like to address the drawbacks many people allude to when discussing this marketing technique. First, there is the matter of security concerns.<br><br>While it is true that sellers should not leave their valuables out during an open house, I have never encountered an issue with theft during any of the open houses I have been involved with. **Other than nosey neighbors, there are actually far fewer concerns to be had regarding open houses than some may think.**

In fact, having an open house is critical. Almost 87% of my team’s listings in the past 24 months have sold through an open house. This is because 98% of buyers today will begin their search online through various internet portals.

After doing all this looking around on the internet, these same buyers tend to want the opportunity to visit the home and view it in-person. And due to having busy schedules, most buyers prefer visiting through open houses rather than having to make a specific appointment to see the property. **For the most part, my team hosts open houses on Sundays from between 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.** This large window of time allows buyers to drop by at their leisure.

These days, open houses are as important as ever. Also, open houses can provide a convenient option for sellers who have pets or small children that would make individual appointments with buyers difficult. Overall, this step in the real estate process is much more helpful than it is often given credit for.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
