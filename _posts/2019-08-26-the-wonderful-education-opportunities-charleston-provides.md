There are plenty of great educational opportunities here in Charleston.

Since the 2019 school year is underway, I thought I’d take a moment to review all the great schooling options for families in our area.&nbsp;

Charleston is a wonderful place to educate your children. There are plenty of opportunities for different types of education—we have schools that focus on academics, schools that focus on art, schools that focus on sports, etc. I used to be a Charleston County teacher in both the public and private sector, so take it from me when I say **we have a wide variety of great schools that allow our students to learn in the best way for them.**&nbsp;

For example, we have schools designed for primary and older elementary children which allow them to be in small groups that split into three separate grades. Three of my younger children attend Daniel Island School, which is a K-8 school, and one of the benefits of attending there is that the 8th graders can read to the kindergarteners.

Academic Magnet High School and the Charleston School of the Arts are two more prestigious schools you can consider sending your kids to. Academic Magnet High School is consistently rated as one of the top high schools in the nation, while the Charleston School of the Arts offers plenty of opportunities for kids with artistic talent.&nbsp;

My oldest son is a student at Oceanside Collegiate Academy, which allows him to focus on a single sport and earn college credit at the same time. Not everyone there is a student-athlete, but this is a great opportunity for student-athletes to gain college credit.

There are opportunities for online education as well. One year, my children mixed home-schooling with online correspondence and were still able to focus on sports.&nbsp;

**As a mom and a teacher, I’ve dealt with many different types of schooling, and one type of education doesn’t apply to all students.** You have to find out what works for your particular student. In my family, we change schools from year to year to make sure my kids have the right fit.&nbsp;

This is one of my favorite topics, and I know that trying to find the right school for your children as you move to a new area is hard, so if you have any more questions about all the schooling options here in Charleston, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
