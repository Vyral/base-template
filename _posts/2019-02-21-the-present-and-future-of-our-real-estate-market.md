With one month down and many more to go in 2019, I’m going to look into my crystal ball and let you know what I think the future of our real estate market holds.

So far, 2019 is showing promise: The tumultuous period we experienced with the stock market has passed and, barring another government shutdown, **we should have continued stability in the market as the year progresses.**

And thanks to the Fed’s announcement that it’ll suspend any rate hikes for the immediate future, we can expect stability with interest rates as well. This bodes well for the real estate market, on the whole.

**Locally, we are seeing inventory levels jump up again,** which is a welcome change for buyers who may have been on the market but, after a while, left in defeat because they didn’t want to deal with the stress of multiple-offer scenarios. Now, sellers are taking a closer look at reasonable offers and allowing for room to negotiate. &nbsp;

Our market is bucking the market shift that’s currently being felt in other parts of the country. This isn’t to say that the shift won’t reach us eventually, but a few factors have insulated us up to this point:

* Utah’s very conservative local government
* Continued growth of “Silicon Slopes”
* The inland port

**The future is certainly bright for our local economy and, in my view, our year-round primary resident population will experience sustained growth.**

As you probably know, the snow we get here makes an impression on buyers. Outdoor activities like skiing capture a unique feeling in buyers who want to hold onto that memory and invest in a second home. Last year, “impulse buys” were few and far between, but **the snowfall we’ve had this year has given us a much better picture.**

You may be wondering what this means for your real estate business. In truth, the most important information for your business is to have the right models and systems so that you can stay top of mind and in constant communication with your database.

If you know there’s room for improvement in that facet of your business, please give me a call. I’d love to have a conversation with you about all the fantastic resources that will be afforded to you through Keller Williams!
