Welcome back to our video blog. Today we are going to talk about how to improve your credit score so you can buy a home. Your credit score is an essential piece ind determining your buying power. Today we are going to talk about the 3 main components you have to look at to increase your credit score. Here are the 3 steps to improving your score

1. Know your credit score
There are a lot of different options out there for you to determine what your credit score is. There are 3 different bureaus that determine your score. You can get your scores directly from the Transunion, Equifax, and Experion bureaus, which you will have to pay for, or you can get them from any number of free credit score sites.

2. Get your score up
In order to do this, you have to limit your debt and make sure you are managing your credit wisely. Making payments on time and reducing your amount of debt will help you out immensely.

3. Get some help
For this step, you need to get out there and talk to someone who can help you out. A credit repair company is one option, or you can give us a call and we can get you in touch with some people that can help you out.
