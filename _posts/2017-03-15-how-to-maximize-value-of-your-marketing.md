When you sell real estate, it's important to maximize the value of your marketing.

Most of us use email consistently to communicate with our clients, and that's a good thing. With many of our clients having a high net worth, though, they get a lot of emails. You probably have a communication schedule that follows a marketing calendar as part of your business plan.

When you deploy a message, you'll get a response from maybe 2% to 5% of the recipients if you're luckyâ€”but what about the rest of them?

**When you deploy a piece of marketing, set a reminder for yourself on your calendar for two to three days after to call the recipients.** Be very purposeful about these calls and pick out a piece of content from what was deployed that you can use to start a dialogue. You want a good reason to start a conversation over the phone.

They might not have a current real estate need, but they might know somebody who does. They might have a real estate need in the near future. We all know that one-on-one time is the most productive time to spend with a client, and we're challenged by that since many of our clients don't live here. That's why being able to get them on the phone is important.

In the end, don't just rely on the marketing to do all the heavy lifting. Be purposeful about your follow up!

If you have any more questions about how to do this or about your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to hear from you.
