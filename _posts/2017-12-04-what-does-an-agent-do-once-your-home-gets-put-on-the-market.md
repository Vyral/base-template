Today I want to talk about some of the things I do once one of our clients’ homes goes live on the multiple listing service (or MLS) so you can understand what agents do once a home gets listed.

**When I list a home, I let the seller know that there are some key factors to pay attention to.**

If it was your home, for example, the first thing we’d have to pay attention to is the traffic we get through your home. If we’re getting traffic, the MLS system is working, but if we’re not getting any offers or any hint of an offer, the home is probably priced too high. If the home’s not getting any traffic at all or we’re not scheduling at least two showings a week, it’s also probably priced too high.

The reason I know this is I talk to buyers every single day, and I watch the amount of traffic coming through my sellers’ homes very closely. {% include pullquote.html %}

**Another important thing I do is gather feedback.**I’m always watching and talking to other agents and getting feedback from them about what their buyers did or what buyers potentially don’t like about your home.

We don’t just list your home and wait for a buyer. We’re always gathering data and gathering feedback so we can make sure your home is priced right and we can sell it for top dollar in the least amount of time with the least number of hassles.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
