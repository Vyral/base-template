On today’s episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” we’re taking a look at one of my favorite downtown restaurants: Juniper.&nbsp;

To give you all a better idea of what makes Juniper great, and how it got its start, I met up with general manager Derek Hillman.&nbsp;

Opened six years ago by first-time restaurateur Justin Thompson, Juniper has been a local favorite ever since. Juniper offers standout entrees such as seared duck, fried chicken curry, and a refreshing seared ahi salad.&nbsp;

Of course, Juniper’s menu is always changing. **New dishes are released each week to fit the restaurants ever-shifting themes, as well as the seasons.** It’s no wonder why Juniper’s growth comes from its kitchen, where head chef Neil Trumpy works his culinary magic.&nbsp;

Chef Trumpy received his education from the Oregon Culinary Institute, where he developed a skill set based around to sustainability and the use of local ingredients. As you’ll see in today’s episode, watching him work is an amazing sight to behold.&nbsp;

But delectible dishes aren’t the only thing there is to enjoy at Juniper. **Diners can also enjoy any of the many refreshing signature cocktails they offer.** So whether you’re in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what you’re craving at Juniper.&nbsp;

Dining at Juniper is an amazing experience, so be sure to come check it out yourself.&nbsp;

Juniper (located at 324 East 3rd Street in downtown Tulsa) &nbsp;is open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for dinner from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Monday through Saturday.&nbsp;
