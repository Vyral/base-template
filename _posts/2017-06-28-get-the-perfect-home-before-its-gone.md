As you might expect, buyers in today’s market want the best. Desirable, ready-to-buy homes are selling quickly.

This seems obvious. Why wouldn’t you look for the best home out there?

The trouble is that **when everyone wants the best, it can make the best hard to find.** With pristine homes moving off the market just days after listing, sometimes it can feel like you never had a chance to get your offer in and seal the deal on your dream home.

Today, I’m here to offer you a solution called “The Dream Finder Program.”

What we do is compile a secret list of awesome homes that were withdrawn or expired from the market. We contact those homes’ sellers with a letter and use our own methods to get those homes back and ready to sell for buyers like you.

The condition is that if you’re looking for your dream home and want us to help, you must be a ready, willing, and able buyer.

**With how quickly dream homes sell, being ready, willing, and able to buy one will be the key to your success.**

In order to be a ready, willing, and able buyer, you must already have done your pre-qualification, have your mortgage money lined up, and you must be sure by the time you make your move.

We’d love for you to get in touch with us. Let us help you to pre-qualify and become a ready, willing, and able buyer so we can find you your perfect dream home. &nbsp;

If you want more information or have any other questions give us a call or send us an email, soon. We look forward to hearing from you.
