Today we’re over at a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom colonial in the Fairlawn Farms section of Wallingford. We’re getting the house ready for the market, having professional photography done, and doing a bit of professional home staging to enhance the buyer experience. There’s a surprising misconception in the marketplace that home sales are slower in the fall market, but it’s just not true. In fact, there’s a real shortage of homes like this one and there are a lot of buyers out there that are just waiting for something like this. If you have any doubts about putting your home on the market or any questions about what it might be like, I want you to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today.
