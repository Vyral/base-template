Today we are very excited to talk about Cherry Meadows, which is a brand new neighborhood that's still under construction right now. Currently, there are six homes, and most of the construction will be completed by September.

When everything is all said and done, **there will be 39 homes in the entire development.** They will range in price from $269K to $319K. The square footage will range from 1,600 to 2,000, depending on the home.

The exteriors will be landscaped and have fencing. **These homes will be in turnkey condition and ready to be occupied in September.** The prices for these homes may go up once they're available because I think a lot of people will want to live in these homes.

This means you have a great opportunity to lock in your pricing right now and gain some equity.

As far as location goes, Cherry Meadows is close to a lot of nearby hiking trails, as well as the hospitals and the downtown area.

If you would like to tour one of these homes, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would be very happy to help you out!
