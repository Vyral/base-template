{% include youtube.html %}Today’s topic is preparing your home for the winter, the indoors edition. **This is part one of a two part series, and we’ll cover the outside of your home on the next video.** It may not feel like winter now, but it will be here before you know it. To make sure you are prepared for the weather and all that it brings with it, we want to give you some tips today for getting the inside of your home all ready for winter.

**Right now is a great time to go through and thoroughly clean the interior of your home.** We’re talking sweeping, vacuuming, dusting, and even hiring a carpet cleaning service to steam clean or shampoo your floor. \*\*We recommend mopping and sweeping those hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors as well. \*\*

**One area of your home you should pay special attention to is the bathrooms and the kitchen.** Deep clean the countertops to refresh them for the season and get rid of those lingering cold germs.

**Now is also a great time to perform preventative maintenance on your heating system.** It’s not a bad idea to have a service contract with a company to check your heater a few times a year, which will help prolong its life.

Finally, make sure you check those smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and replace their batteries. \*\*Also, check and purge your closets, cabinets, and garage of any unnecessary items and donate them to charity. \*\*

If you have any questions for us about winterizing your home, give us a call or send us an email. We’ll be back with part two next time, and we look forward to hearing from you soon!
