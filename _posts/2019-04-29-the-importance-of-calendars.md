Agents ask me all the time about how to become more productive in their real estate careers. If I had to choose the one thing that will help you with your productivity and business success in general, **I’d choose a calendar.**

It sounds simple, but a calendar can streamline everything. I live and die by my Google calendar—there’s not a single hour in my work week that isn’t mapped out on it.&nbsp;

Every successful person in the history of the world has used a calendar. And when you think about it, we all have the same amount of time in a day—it’s up to each of us how we choose to use it. **We have to be masters of our calendars.**&nbsp;

If you’re a full-time agent, you need to get into some habits. For example, get up at the same time each day and get working. Otherwise, you aren’t controlling your calendar effectively.

Calendars are the best way to get your business on track. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
