Our team is growing, and so today I’m excited to introduce you to our newest agent: Cynthia Matheny.

Before coming to our team, Cynthia worked for nine years as an agent in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was selling over $18 million in real estate there, had a small team, but decided it was time to make a change. 

And Cynthia has much more to offer than just her expertise as an agent. **She also works as a business coach and runs a couple of amazing classes,** like The Art of Asking Powerful Questions. 

Cynthia has also become our resident expert on the DISC assessment—a test which analyzes personality based on four aspects: dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness. The class she teaches on this assessment, called Selling With Style, helps people understand who they are and why they act the way they do. She highly recommends taking this class in order to better understand and navigate the relationships in your life, both business-related and personal.

**The next Selling With Style class will be on Thursday, August 30, so be sure to mark your calendars.** You don’t have to be in sales or real estate to join. This class can help you better connect and communicate within any relationship in your life, whether it’s with a spouse, friend, a coworker, or otherwise.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to either Cynthia or myself. You can get in touch with Cynthia by email at **[cynthia@carolinaspropertyshop.com](mailto:cynthia@carolinaspropertyshop.com)** or by phone at **[(208) 724-7148](tel:208-724-7148){: target="_blank"}**.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information from me, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
