One of the questions I get a lot from clients is, “Is it a buyer’s or a seller’s market?”

**Right now, we’re in a seller’s market.** In a lot of areas in Columbus, we’re seeing multiple offers on homes. Some buyers are having to waive contingencies or make other concessions just to get into homes. Year over year, our price appreciation is around 6% in central Ohio.

When our area is in a seller’s market and there is low inventory, it’s a simple question of supply and demand. If there are more buyers than there are homes for sale, the median price tends to go up. This is especially true in the springtime when there is a lot more competition.

If you’re a buyer, it might be a good idea to buy before then. When the spring market hits its groove, we’ll see a lot more homes on the market, but we’ll also see a lot more buyers looking for homes.

Another topic we get asked about quite frequently is interest rates. They spiked after President Trump was elected to office, but since then they have stabilized. **Rates are still at historic lows, so it’s a great time to either refinance or buy a home.**

What does all this mean for buyers and sellers as a whole?

In desirable areas where there is a lot of competition and low inventory, buyers can expect to encounter bidding wars and multiple offer situations. In some areas of Columbus, though, there are still healthy markets with plenty of inventory available. If you are a buyer, be smart and look for homes in those areas.

If you’re a seller, make sure you talk to a real estate agent you know and trust so you understand your home’s value and what your best strategy is moving forward.

As always, if you’re looking to buy or sell real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to be your top choice.
