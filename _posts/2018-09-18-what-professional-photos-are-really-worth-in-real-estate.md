You’ve probably heard the saying “A picture is worth a thousand words,” but I believe it’s worth more than that.

**Zillow, the National Association of Realtors, and other independent agencies have done studies on how valuable professional photographs are to the real estate process.**

These studies have found that great pictures are critical to the marketing of any property. Many buyers won’t even consider a property if there aren’t multiple high-quality photos of it on the listing.

Poor photos will automatically send up a red flag for anyone who sees them.

This is why we at The Moving On Team hire a professional photographer on our buyers’ behalf to make sure that the pictures representing their listing are truly top notch.

Our photographer will take at least 50 photos of your property, create a 3D virtual tour, and record video footage **so that we can get the highest possible exposure for your home.**

So the bottom line is this: A picture isn’t just worth a thousand words—in real estate, a picture can be worth thousands of dollars.
