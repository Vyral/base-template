Today we're here with the latest numbers for the Clarksville real estate market. The market is starting to shift, though. We'll discuss how the shift will affect both buyers and sellers today.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.valeriehunterkelly.com/search/residentialadvancedsearch.aspx" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>

 We are back again to talk about one of our favorite topics: the latest market statistics. We’ve got the latest numbers for the Clarksville market and we think you may be surprised by some of them.

**The biggest thing to note is that right now we only have 1,279 properties on the market for sale.** That might sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. At this time last year, we had 1,600 to 1,800 homes for sale. As a result, when we head into spring, we’ll have lower inventory at that time. This is just another reason that you should purchase your home now.

Here are some more important statistics to take note of:

• Closed sales are up by 15% over last year, from 2,958 to 3,401
• The average sales price is up by 13.08% over last year, from $168,600 to $173,800
• The average days on market has decreased by about 5.4%, from 92 to 87 days

We are slowly shifting toward a seller’s market, so now is the time for buyers to get out there and strike a deal. If you have any questions for us about buying or selling, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
