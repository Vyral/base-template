<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’re on track to hit our 2020 goals, and we couldn’t do it without you.</em></p>

In December 2019, we set a goal of 125 referrals for 2020. Now, near the end of March, **we’ve reached 38, meaning that we are indeed on pace to meet our goal for the year.** We don’t have a topical real estate post for you today, but we want to extend a deep, heartfelt thank you for all of the referrals you’ve given us thus far.&nbsp;

**We’re grateful for everything you’ve done for us and all of the wonderful people you’ve introduced to us**—your friends, family members, coworkers, etc. It’s an honor to provide a high level of service to our community. Nothing is more rewarding than helping families invest in something that will move their lives forward positively.&nbsp;

Our goal for April is 20 referrals. I’d love to be able to report back to you on Cinco de Mayo with great news of us having once again nailed our mark. Until then, be safe, and reach out to us if you have any questions, or if you or anyone you know is thinking of buying or selling a home. Keep those referrals coming; we sincerely appreciate your support\!
