“Who pays for the utilities?” is one of the questions we get almost every time we do an owners meeting. **The tenants will normally pay for electricity, water, cable, internet, alarm service, etc.** We need to tell the tenant upfront about whatever utilities we charge them for.

In an HOA situation, the water and the sewer will sometimes be paid for by the owner. The owner will get an HOA statement from the Board of Water. We sometimes have problems with that because the owners don't always give us HOA statements with enough time to get them to the tenants.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about who pays utilities, you can call us at (808) 445-9223 or email us at [Info@HiPacificPM.com](mailto:Info@HiPacificPM.com). We look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
