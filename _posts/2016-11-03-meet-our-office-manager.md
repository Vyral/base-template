*Priscilla Jacobo is our Office Manager. She wears a lot of hats to ensure that our business continues to thrive.*

We are back to introduce another great member of our team. Priscilla Jacobo is our Office Manager here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management. She actually started out as a tenant at one of our properties. **She was impressed by our genuine character and how we took care of her, so she decided that she wanted to be part of our team.**

As the office manager, Priscilla handles all the bookkeeping, invoicing, and back-end tasks to ensure that we really take care of our owners and their properties. We are grateful to have Priscilla on our team.

If you have any questions for us, don't hesitate to reach out by phone or email. We would love to hear from you!
