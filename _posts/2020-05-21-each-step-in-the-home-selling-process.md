<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is each step in the home selling process so you know what to expect.</em></p>

Today I’m explaining each step in the home selling process so you know what to expect when it comes time to sell your house.&nbsp;

The first thing we do with sellers is have a consultation. **We’ll put together a comparative market analysis to find the property’s value.** Second, we write a listing agreement, which is a contract that allows us to sell your home. Next, we have professional photos and video taken of your house, and post the listing to our website and most other real estate sites such as Zillow, Trulia, etc.

Then we’ll discuss how to prepare your home for sale, making sure you have everything in order and staged properly so you can get top dollar. After that, we’ll conduct showings and likely receive an offer. Once we obtain an offer, we’ll ensure it meets your financial needs. Next comes the home inspection, and we’ll negotiate any requests that come up.&nbsp;

After that, the buyer must get approved, and the contract goes to the underwriters, then to the title company. **The title company makes sure there are no liens, incumbents, or anything out of the ordinary.** Lastly, the closing process begins. When we officially close, you have finally sold your home.

If you would like a market analysis done on your property, just visit our website. We would be glad to speak with you about it as well. If you have questions about the selling process or real estate in general, we can be reached via phone or email. We would love to help you.
