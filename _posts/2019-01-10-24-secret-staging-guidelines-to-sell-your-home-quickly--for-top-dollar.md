<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I want to share all 24 of my secret staging tips that will help you sell your home quickly and for top dollar.</em></p>

**Here are my 24 secret staging guidelines that will help your home sell quickly, for top dollar, and with the least amount of stress:**

**1.&nbsp;**Remove all unnecessary furniture from the interior. This will make the inside look as big as possible, like a model home.

**2.&nbsp;**Let in as much natural light as possible—don’t block or cover any of your windows.

**3.&nbsp;**Move furniture away from room corners so those rooms look bigger in pictures. How your home looks online will prompt buyers to want to visit it in person.

**4.&nbsp;**Pack away all your knicknacks.

**5.&nbsp;**Remove any centerpieces from any tables. This is another tip that will help make a room look bigger.

**6.&nbsp;**Remove any personal photos, including those hanging from the walls.

**7.&nbsp;**Clear out your closets of any clothes that aren’t in season. This will emphasize their size and depth, and you won’t be needing those out-of-season clothes anyway.

**8.&nbsp;**Have your home professionally cleaned.

**9.&nbsp;**Repaint everything. For the interior, try an off-white or a beige color. This a cheap, easy tip that will bring you a large return, and it also brings us to our next tip…

**10.&nbsp;**Remove any wallpaper. Wallpaper just isn’t “in” right now.

**11.&nbsp;**Wash the inside and outside of your windows.

**12.&nbsp;**Put the boxes you used to pack everything up in storage.

**13.&nbsp;**Clear everything out of your attic.

**14.&nbsp;**Spruce up your front door area. First impressions are very important.

**15.&nbsp;**Clean and fix up your garage. The better your garage looks, the higher the price your home will sell at.

**16.&nbsp;**Clean and fix up your basement. Make it look as spotless as your kitchen. If need be, repaint the walls while you’re at it.

**17.&nbsp;**Clean off your water heater.

**18.&nbsp;**Make your kitchen look squeaky clean. Also, clear off the countertops, the tops of your cabinets, and the face of your refrigerator.

**19.&nbsp;**Make your bathrooms look squeaky clean. Additionally, declutter your shower areas, vanity mirrors, and remove any shelving units.

**20.&nbsp;**Neutralize your home’s decorating theme. In other words, remove anything that will make the home non-duplicatable.

**21.&nbsp;**Don’t over-decorate. You don’t stage a home to decorate it—you stage it to sell it.

**22.&nbsp;**Set the mood. Turn on all the lights and have some soft music playing.

**23.&nbsp;**Spruce up your home’s whole exterior. Mulch all of the flower beds, trim the bushes, repair any cracked sidewalks/walkways, etc.

**24.&nbsp;**Make sure your electrical system is safe. Cap all loose wires, replace any frayed cable wires, and be prepared to install GFI receptacles within six feet of water.
