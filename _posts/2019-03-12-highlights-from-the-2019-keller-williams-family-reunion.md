Please enjoy some highlights from our recent trip.

We made it to the 2019 Keller Williams Family Reunion, and we wanted to share with you some highlights from our trip. Family Reunion is the industry’s most powerful training event.

Agents from all over the world have the opportunity to gather with thousands of top associates for four days to network, re-energize and take our business to the next level. This is excellence we cannot Ignore.

The fact is, Family Reunion is one of the few times each year that we are able to experience [educational events and training](https://familyreunion.kw.com/){: target="_blank"} from those who have already achieved success in their careers in mass quantities (close to 18,000 KW associates attended this year).

If you have any questions about local real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
