We made it to the 2019 Keller Williams Family Reunion, and we wanted to share with you some highlights from our trip. Family Reunion is the industry’s most powerful training event.

Agents from all over the world have the opportunity to gather with thousands of top associates for four days to network, re-energize and take our business to the next level.

Close to 18,000 associates attended this year in New Orleans, Louisiana! We had the extreme pleasure of attending as a team, and learned so much! We love attending, because as much as it helps our business, it helps us refocus on what is most important as well. As a team we were able to gain knowledge from top associates all over the world, giving us insights others may not have. Family Reunion is set up convention style – with multiple breakout sessions throughout the day on various topics and issues affecting the industry. 

We not only learned about the technological advances our company is making, but we also found time to bask in the amazing culture that Keller Williams has. We love being a part of the Keller Williams family for many reasons, but our culture is at the top of the list.

The fact is, Family Reunion is one of the few times each year that we are able to experience [educational events and training](https://familyreunion.kw.com/){: target="_blank"} from those who have already achieved success in their careers in mass quantities.
