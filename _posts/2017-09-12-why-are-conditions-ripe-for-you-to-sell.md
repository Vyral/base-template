Why does it make sense for you to list your home in the fall instead of waiting until next spring?

Whether the market is favorable to buyers or sellers depends on whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market. **Over the past 12 months, there’s been strong buyer demand but not enough sellers to meet that demand, which has made conditions very favorable to sellers. **

If you do decide to take advantage of this opportunity and put your home on the market this fall, **here are five tips that will make your home even more attractive to all those buyers out there:**

**1. Accentuate your home’s curb appeal.** Fall is a great time to spruce up the exterior of your house and make a great first impression on buyers, so lay down some fresh mulch and trim back your bushes.

**2. Keep your holiday displays tasteful.** The approach of the holiday season makes people feel good, and that’s conducive to your home sale. That being said, make sure your holiday displays are tasteful and reasonably done.

**3. Create an inviting interior living space.** This is rule applies all the time, but make sure you declutter the inside of your home and make your space appear as big as possible. You also want buyers to think there is a lot of storage room in your home.

**4. If you have a fireplace, use it.** Fireplaces (especially gas ones) have a strong emotional appeal during the fall and winter

**5. Enhance fall aromas.** There’s nothing like the scent of a great fall evening, so if you can capture that scent inside your house, that’s one more strong emotional connection you can make with buyers.

If you have any questions about any of these tips, you want to know what your home is worth, or you’re thinking about selling your home, don’t hesitate to contact me. I’d be happy to help you in any way I can.
