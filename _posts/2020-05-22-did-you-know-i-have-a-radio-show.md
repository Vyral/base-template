I host a radio show each Monday that’s a great real estate resource.

I want to tell you about a radio show I’ve been conducting for about a year now on KENI 650 on iHeartRadio; it’s called Alaska Top Agent. If you would like to check out the show, it’s on Monday at 2 p.m., though it doesn’t always come on right at that exact moment, so be sure to wait a few minutes. **It’s a 30-minute program** that follows The Sean Hannity Show. Our show is a wonderful resource for any type of real estate transaction.&nbsp;

We take questions, too, so if you have any, you can email me at askdar.com and we’ll be glad to respond on the radio as long as we have an answer. If for some reason we don’t, I’ll call you directly to let you know we’re doing some investigation into your inquiry. If we do use your question on the radio, we’ll send you a Starbucks gift card\!

I have a lender who co-sponsors the program, so every other show is generally about the lending world as it relates to real estate. Sometimes, we also discuss non-profit charity events. If you’re involved with a non-profit charity and you need a bit of exposure, please feel free to contact us. We love to help charities that need a little boost.

Guess what? You don’t even have to wait until Monday to hear the program, **you can visit alaskatopagent.com and check out the many podcasts available from previous shows.&nbsp;**

If you have any real estate needs or have questions you don’t want to be answered on the radio, you can of course still call or email me at [dar@darwalden.com](mailto:dar@darwalden.com). I would love to help you in any way I can.
