I get a lot of questions from renters who are thinking about buying a home. Most commonly, I’m asked about whether it’s better to buy or rent a home in today’s market. It’s a hard question to answer, since everyone’s life situations and needs are different.

**There are some times when renting may make sense.** For example, you may be new to the area or might not be in your home for a long time. It’s hard to recommend buying when a person will leave within a year, as their home likely won’t appreciate enough to cover the costs of selling. So, if your living situation would be short term, it may be best to rent.

**In almost all other cases, though, it’s usually better to buy.** We can’t predict whether our crazy levels of double-digit appreciation will continue, but historically, homes appreciate by about 3% to 4% every year. Let’s say we only have 1% appreciation each year—if you live in a home for seven years and sell it at a 7% increase, that’ll likely cover all of your closing costs and related fees. That means you got to stay in a home for seven years without paying rent. Essentially, you broke even, but you were also able to write off mortgage interest as a tax deduction.

Buying a home makes a lot of sense, and it helps you create a cycle of building equity and using it to move into bigger, better homes. Additionally, you’ll typically see more appreciation on higher-priced homes.

If you have any questions or are ready to begin your home-buying journey, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
