Many people underestimate the possibility of selling your home in the fall or winter. Today, I’ve got some key tips to help you list your property in these later seasons of the year.

First, pay close attention to your curb appeal. I’ll personally admit how hard it is to resist the temptation of buying every decorative seasonal piece I can find. **Finding the balance between a nicely decorated yard and something resembling a farmer’s market can be a slippery slope.**

The right amount of decoration in your front yard or porch can feel welcoming, but too much will quickly turn potential buyers off. Ultimately, you want to enhance your curb appeal instead of obstructing it. Also remember to make sure that fall leaves don’t take a toll on your yard.

On the subject of appearances, **my second tip is to go easy on the holiday displays.** A tasteful display in the winter months will, quite literally, put your home in the best light; but having a home that looks as if you’re trying to compete with the Griswolds (from “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation”) will make your house less sellable.

Natural lighting is sometimes one of the best things for your home. Cleaning your windows and opening your blinds to let in the sunlight will give your home a nice glow. This is especially important on the shorter days that come along during fall and winter months. The right light in your home can make it look bigger and fresher.

The third tip I have for you is to make your home inviting. **Use plush throws on the couch and beds, add accent pillows, and try displaying vases with fall decor.**

Fourth, prepare your fireplace. Whether you are ready to light your fireplace or not, make sure that the mantle and the area around the fireplace looks great.

Finally, make sure that your home smells nice. **Using familiar fall scents like cinnamon can really make your home feel cozy and welcoming to potential buyers.**
