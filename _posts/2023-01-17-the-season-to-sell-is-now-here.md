Let's talk about the selling season. When does it start? When does it end? What's going on?

I tell people they should start listing the weekend of the Super Bowl or right after. That's a good gauge to start getting your house on the market. We're starting to compete with more properties in the spring, and we are in a normal real estate market. So we are going to see more houses come on the market. Again, we will probably see more competition because of everything that's been going on with inflation and the volatility of the interest rates. **We want to make sure that we get ahead of that.**

One of the main things I will share with you is that is consistent for us—price matters. Your home has to be in exceptional condition, and we'll walk you through that. Then, of course, marketing, which we've already got covered. So the only thing that's really up to you is the price point, and it's really up to us to present where you should be.

I'm not a doom-and-gloom person. I won't go into these listing appointments scaring you to death, and neither does anybody on my team. We just provide information. I will tell you, however, that there has been a big difference between the sellers that absolutely know and trust that I'm guiding them to a successful sale and the ones who maybe have watched too many TikTok videos or they're just getting bad advice, or they have their family member in their ear. I can tell you that the ones who've listened to me have had smooth, successful sales. **We want to make sure that we eliminate as many of those hurdles and bumps as possible.**

So, again, we understand there's outside information. We understand that there might be some questions, but when we come into your home and give you a strategy session on how to best sell your home, we do it with the best intention to help you win. So call or email us, and we’ll help you with your real estate needs.
