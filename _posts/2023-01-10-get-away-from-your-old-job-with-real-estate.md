Today we’re interviewing one of our fantastic agents, Brendan. His real estate journey started when he realized he needed a change in career, but at first, he didn’t know where to go. He wanted a job that could fulfill the wants and needs of his family, but he also wanted something that was emotionally satisfying.&nbsp;

Fortunately, Brendan got connected with a health company in their IT department. It was a good place to start, but he wasn’t passionate about the work at all. Each day, he dreaded waking up and heading to his job. **Eventually, he broke down and told his wife that something needed to change.**

Soon, they realized they needed to take a leap of faith and make a career change. By talking to one of our other agents, Jennie, Brendan learned more about what daily life as a real estate agent would be like and what our core values are. He decided he wanted to give it a shot and was hired onto our team.&nbsp;

**So far, real estate has been a blessing in Brendan’s life.** Being able to work directly with people and help them achieve their homeownership dreams has been fulfilling in a way his other job couldn’t touch.&nbsp;
