<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are five challenging questions people who have unexpectedly come into owning a property tend to face, and today we would like to offer you a solution to each.</em></p>

If you find yourself as a personal representative or an heir of a property as an estate, we want to help you. One of the things our team finds is that there are five challenging questions most people face while in this position. We’re here to help, and want to make this scenario easier for you to navigate. Here are those five questions:

**1. What is the best option for you to proceed with?** Do you want to sell the property, rent it out, or keep and enjoy it?

**2. What should you do with all the belongings in the home?** There will obviously be some things friends or family members may want, but what about the rest?

**3. What if you’re not local?**

**4. What if you need repairs done?**

**5. Who can you trust to help?**
