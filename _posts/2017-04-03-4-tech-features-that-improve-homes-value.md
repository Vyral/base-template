Smart home technology has improved a lot over the years. Here’s what buyers are looking for in today’s market.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

Having the latest technology in your home will help it get more attention from buyers, both online and in-person. **Here are four tech upgrades you can make in your home to maximize its value when the time comes to sell:**

**1. Smart thermostat.** They keep your home at the temperature you like when you are home, and keep it at an energy-efficient temperature when you’re away. These thermostats can help bring energy bills way down.

**2. Surveillance cameras.** Nowadays, they are pretty inexpensive. There is even a doorbell that comes with its own webcam. You want something newer that is compatible with smart technology.

**3. Smart culinary equipment.** No-touch faucets are great for keeping germs off faucets, and a fridge that tells you when you’re running low on milk or Coors Light is an added bonus for buyers.
