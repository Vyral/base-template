Are we nearing a bubble in the real estate market? I’m here today to discuss.

We’re hearing a lot of concern that we may be reaching another housing bubble. I recently read an article from the NAR, who discovered that the median existing home price for all homes in January was up by about 5.8%. **That’s just about what we’re seeing in Hoboken.**

This is coming off of 71 consecutive months of price increases, which has led some people to believe that home prices are overinflated. Zillow recently issued a statement saying that if the bubble had not happened, home values would have appreciated at a steady pace and the median home price would have been at or above the current value.

**As you can see in the video above, we’ve seen a steady increase since the crash.&nbsp;**When you take into account historic appreciation, we’re right where we should be at a market. There is a lot of equity build into our homes to help protect sellers as well.

So far we’re seeing a seller’s market locally and we should be very comfortable with where home values are at. If you have any questions about your home or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
