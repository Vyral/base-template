What is the best time to get your home on the market?

Everyone likes to wait until May or June to list their home. However, I suggest that **it might actually be better to get that done a bit earlier.**

The reason I suggest listing in March or April is that a lot of other people also wait until May and June to list. **You’d be setting yourself up to list at the same time as your competition.**

If you list your home on the market in March or April, you’re beating your competition to the punch. There will be fewer homes on the market, which means **you'll likely get a higher sales price and a faster sales time.**
