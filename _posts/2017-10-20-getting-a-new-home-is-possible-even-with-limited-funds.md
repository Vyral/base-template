Today I want to share some information about a new program we’re offering through the Chenoa Fund.

This program is a great way for people who lack the money required for a home purchase to be able to make their move. Using this program, you can obtain the necessary 3.5% down payment on an FHA mortgage as a gift.

Best of all, qualifying is simple. **You will need to have a credit score of at least 620, but this is one of the few requirements.**

If you’ve got limited funds, this program can help you get into a new home much more easily.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
