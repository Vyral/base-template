You are a seller. Your house is on the market. You get an offer and the buyer says they will close in 30 days. But, just before the expected date your house should close, you find out they are unable to close on time. What happens now?

You have a couple options. **You could walk away from the contract and put the house back on the market.**

Or, you could continue to wait. To know if this is a possibility, **you will need to know why the buyer is asking for a longer closing time.**

Maybe they have their own home to sell and their closing is later. Your home is supposed to close on the 25th and their home is supposed to close five days later on the 30th. They tell you that they need the money from that sale to buy your house. If this is the case, **I would tell you to give them extra time.**

However, if they say they need an additional 30 days to sell their home because they did not get an offer, you have are two options.

I can put your house on the market and hope that somebody makes an offer and closes on it in that next 30 days. Or, you can stay with this buyer

If you stay with this buyer, **you need to protect yourself.** I would advise you to ask for extra earnest money in case the same thing happens again and they say they still can’t buy your home. This extra earnest money will cover any expenses, such as the taxes, mortgage, and insurance. This will even out your risk, help you protect yourself, and still allow them the additional time.

It does always come down to the situation. I will look at the situation and make a decision based upon why they are asking. Maybe their own home’s closing is delayed, they did not get an offer like they expected, or they need to provide extra paperwork to their lender and resubmit. It is not always black and white but that is where your Realtor will be able to help you make the best decision.

If you have any questions, are in a similar situation, or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to help you.
