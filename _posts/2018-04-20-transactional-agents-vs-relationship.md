Most of the agents in our industry are transactional instead of relationship-based. Here’s why you should work with one who’s relationship-based.

What’s the difference between being transactional and being relationship-based in the real estate industry? The answer lies in how our team does business.

I read an alarming article the other day that described Realtors along the same lines as personal injury attorneys and insurance salesman. In other words, it held our profession in a really low regard. This was disheartening to me because I know how hard my team works and how much we love our clients. Overall, it was hard to read this article and think that the public thinks so little of Realtors.

I think the reason for this is **most Realtors are transactional instead of relationship-based.** My firm is relationship-based.

Let me tell you a quick story of how a transactional mindset works. I met with a couple last week who listed their home last year with a Realtor who was a friend of theirs. After six months, their home hadn’t sold and they were ready to take it off the market. When they told their Realtor this, their Realtor threatened to sue them for $8,000.

That’s not how you build a business, build a career, or build trust with the public. I’ve never, ever told someone that I was going to sue them if they took their home off the market. In fact, we’re one of the few firms that offer an easy-exit listing agreement. If you’re one of our sellers and you want to take your home off the market, just call us up and we’d be happy to do that for you. I value the long-term relationship our team has with each of our clients—not the short-term, transactional gain of $8,000.

Long story short, we plan on selling this couple’s home. If their previous Realtor would have agreed to take their home off the market last fall, they might have retained the client this spring.

**We want to earn your business, and we want to do business with you for life.**

If you ever have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
