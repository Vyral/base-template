Kaaren Hall, the CEO of uDirect IRA Services, is back to go into more detail about using your self-directed IRA to invest in real estate.

<br>If you have a self-directed IRA but don’t have enough money in it to purchase an investment property on your own, then **you can partner with another person to make that purchase.** You can partner with one person or multiple people, and it doesn’t matter if they are allowed or disallowed to your IRA.

<br>Disallowed people are your lineal ascendants and descendants. For example, your spouse, parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, and their spouses are disallowed from the IRA. However, you can partner with them so long as the investment property is part of a new deal.

<br>For example, let’s say you and your father decide to invest in a property together using your IRA and your father’s cash. As long as it’s a new deal, which means that neither you nor your father had ownership in that property to begin with, then you can invest in that property together.

<br>**If you only partner with one person, you can split everything in the transaction 50/50.** So, 50% of the earnest money would come from your IRA and the other half would come from your father. Everything from the property tax bill to the appraisal fee would be split right down the middle; after you close on the property, the rent checks would be split the same way.

<br>If you work with a property manager, then the property manager will split the rent check up among the owners. You will never sell your portion to your dad, and he cannot sell to you. You do not live in or personally use the property. You don’t do any of the work on the property—you keep it at arm’s length.

<br>**Basically, you cannot have any sweat equity in the property,** or it would be considered a disallowed transaction.

To open an account, all you have to do is click the link, choose which IRA you want, open the account, and get it funded. Once your IRA is funded, you can use it to invest in property.
