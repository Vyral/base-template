Today I’d like to take a break from talking about the market. Instead, I’m bringing you some interesting fishing facts.

This week we wanted to do something a little different.

Instead of talking about the market, today we’re going to talk about some fishing trivia.

Did you know that when salmon spawn, they travel 1,900 miles up the Yukon river to do so? Additionally, Alaska is home to five different species of salmon: the King, the Coho, the Sockeye, the Chum, and the Pink.

Of all of these, and of all Pacific salmon in general, the Pink is the smallest. And **the Chum has one of the widest ranges of all Pacific salmon** and can be found throughout the world including here in Alaska, but also in California, Canada, Russia, and Japan.

As another fun fact about salmon, the females, just like chickens, are called “hens.”

But Alaska isn’t just home to salmon. The Pacific halibut is one of the most sought after fish in our state.

I remember the first time I ever saw a halibut. **When I noticed both eyes on one side, I truly thought something was wrong with that fish.** Another thing that might surprise some people about the halibut is its size.

The largest halibut to have been recorded weighed 495 pounds. Any halibut larger than 300 pounds is called a Barn Door halibut. Smaller halibuts, though, are called Chicken halibuts.

Fishing season this year may be over—but, if you’re a fisherman, remember to be safe and have fun when it comes around again.

If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
