First of all, you need to look at who is on the real estate team. What background do the team members have? This is one of the most important financial decisions of your life, so you want to work with experienced agents. I am a listing agent, which means I only work with home sellers. When you work with a listing agent, there is no division of loyalty because they are there solely to protect your interests and focus on you. We also have a new listing coordinator that handles all the details in our real estate team.

A good real estate team like ours will also have a full-time marketing specialist. The marketing specialist should be able to market your home online with stellar search engine capacity and attract lots of attention to your home. You should also look for a team with a transaction manager, who will take care of you from the time you go under contract to the time of closing. Every real estate transaction involves a ton of paperwork, and the transaction manager is there to make sure everything runs smoothly.

Of course, these are just a few factors you should consider when hiring a real estate agent. We'll be back with more tips for hiring the right agent for you. If you have any questions in the meantime, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
