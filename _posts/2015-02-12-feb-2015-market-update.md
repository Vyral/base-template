Today I'd like to provide you with a brief market update for the Elk Grove and Sacramento areas. I usually like to reserve these market analyses for individual cases, but today I'll give you a generalized look at what's happening in our area.

* Low interest rates have kept the market strong because it's an incentive for buyers to purchase, and it's also making sellers want to list their homes because of increased demand.
* We're currently seeing about 3 months of inventory in Elk Grove. With our marketing strategies we can probably cut that number down to one month (contact us if you want to sell quickly and for more money).
* For the most part, buyers want to come out and purchase homes right now because of high affordability. New loan products from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with only a 3% down payment requirement should also bolster buying power, which should cause an extra surge of activity in Elk Grove.

This is a generalized report on our market, but please feel free to contact me if you would like to sit down and discuss your particular situation. As always, please don't hesitate to contact my team with any questions!
