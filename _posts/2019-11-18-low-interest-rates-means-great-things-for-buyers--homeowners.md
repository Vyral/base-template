Great things are happening in our St. Charles market. Not only is there a lot of activity, but the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates several times. What does this mean for you? According to Bill Panley of Caliber Home Loans, my guest in today’s video, this dip in interest rates is a great opportunity for eager buyers or homeowners looking to refinance. In his words, rates shoot up like a rocket and float down like a feather, so if you’re looking to lock in a low rate, now’s the time to do so. If you have any other mortgage questions, we encourage you to call Bill at (630) 330-5626. If you want to know your home’s value and talk more about whether refinancing is the right option for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to my team and me. We’d love to help you.
