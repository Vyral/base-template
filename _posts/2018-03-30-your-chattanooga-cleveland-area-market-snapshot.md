  With today’s market snapshot, I’ll fill you in on the current market
  conditions and what they mean for buyers and sellers. I often get questions
  about what type of real estate market we’re currently in. At the moment, we’re
  in a strong seller’s market. Sellers should act quickly to get the most for
  their homes, and buyers need to be prepared early. To hear more about the
  market, watch my latest video.
