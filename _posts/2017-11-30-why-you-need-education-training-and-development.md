Development, education, and training are very important as a real estate agent. My team and I travel through the country to meet top producers and learn how to grow our business.
{: .present-before-paste}

There are a few different things you can do to improve your mindset, get educated, and grow your business.
{: .present-before-paste}

**First, you can always listen to podcasts.** If you don’t have the money or your team doesn’t have the budget to pay for training and coaching, then the best thing you can do is listen to podcasts.
{: .present-before-paste}

There is a great real estate website called [BiggerPockets.com](http://www.BiggerPockets.com) that has hundreds of podcasts by people who work in real estate, property management, investing, and home flipping. They do interviews with people from all over the country, and I’ve listened to a lot of them. This is a great way to learn from successful people in the industry and improve your own business. &nbsp;

I’ve mentioned “The 10X Rule” by Grant Cardone before, and [he also has a great podcast](https://grantcardonetv.com/podcasts/). Pat Hiban does a podcast called [Real Estate Rockstar Radio.](https://hibandigital.com/)

If you have a smartphone, a free podcast can help you grow your business. The people who are on these podcasts sell 500 and 800 homes a year. If you can’t afford to fly around to meet top producers, podcasts are a great resource for you.

In addition to listening to podcasts, you can also watch training videos. You need to be getting better. On our team, I record three to five videos a week on how to improve your skills. I’ll record myself calling 15 leads and upload that to our video library. We’ve been building our video library for over a year now, and it’s been very helpful.

Go on YouTube and watch people make prospecting calls to FSBOs, expireds, commercial—whatever kind of real estate you want to sell. Watching videos will help you immensely. &nbsp;

**Your third option is to do what we do—meet with top producers**. I’ve met with teams in San Diego, Wichita, and Fargo, North Dakota. Each of these teams sells more than 400 homes a year. It’s really helpful to listen to them.
{: .present-before-paste}

Even details like what kind of desk they work on and their office layout can be helpful. I’ve bought five standing-sitting desks. I’ve also gotten a few ideas for upgrading our office space to make the work environment better for our agents and our clients as well.

After you’ve visited the agent on site, call them up and ask about their habits. They might be selling 100 homes a year already, and it will take a few years of utilizing those habits to get you there. First, focus on selling 24 houses. Next year, try for 35. Then 50. Try to grow by 20% every year. If you go from $100,000 homes to $150,000 homes to $180,000 homes year after year, then you’re still growing your business.
{: .present-before-paste}

If you can’t afford to travel around on your own, there are many different real estate seminars that you can attend. You can pay about $800 and get an entire week of real estate education. If you’re not sure which conference to go to, I’ll invite you to one of our next ones.
{: .present-before-paste}

**Books are another great training resource.** I prefer to listen to audiobooks. I listen to about an hour a day, take notes, and read the notes again later. I share all of these resources with my team.
{: .present-before-paste}

I also provide coaching to my team. We change up our coach every six months to a year. If we want to learn about geographic farming, then we’re going to coach with someone who mails to 10,000 homes every month.
{: .present-before-paste}

It’s very important that you continue to educate yourself and grow your mindset. Use a combination of resources to truly grow your business. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Follow the footsteps of other successful agents and try to do something that other people in your area aren’t doing.

I take training, education, and development very seriously, and I work hard to provide these training opportunities to my team. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions you may have. We would be happy to help you!
