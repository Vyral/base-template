Today I’m joined by fellow KW agent Hong McDonald to talk about leadership lessons and client care.&nbsp;

How have the lessons Hong has learned from her accomplishments helped her in life and business? In her words, **the more she does for other people, the more she gets done period.** She has to manage her family life, business life, and all her nonprofit work, but she’s most productive when she’s busy.&nbsp;

“In many ways,” she says, “I get a chance to serve the community, be with my family, serve the clients, and it’s done me really well, and I’m really blessed to have that.”

How have the leadership roles she’s earned in various organizations helped her in a typical real estate transaction? There are a lot of people involved behind the scenes in a real estate transaction, so **setting priorities is the first step in managing it (i.e., outlining what needs to be done and when).** Her time management skills have been well honed through juggling her work life, family life, and through giving back.&nbsp;

Hong’s parents instilled in her a tremendous work ethic. According to her, they grew up with practically nothing, and they told her that she would have to work for what she wanted. It’s because of this that she started working when she was very young and never stopped. Along the way, she’s learned to appreciate the process.&nbsp;

Like a lot of people, Hong first started visiting Park City just to ski. Her first trip was back in 1997, and that lasted five days. The next year she visited again, and that time, stayed for 10 days. The year after that, she and her family stayed for a whole summer.&nbsp;

Being a single mom and raising two kids has helped her create more balance in her life because her parents taught her to use challenges as an opportunity to become a better person. She notes that she’s had plenty of help from various people in all facets of her life, and in my opinion, this is what makes her such a great mentor.&nbsp;

Hong’s motto is to **do what you love and love what you do.** She loves being in Park City and enjoying everything it has to offer, and she loves real estate. She doesn’t just talk the talk, either—she walks the walk by skiing, golfing, and participating in other lifestyle activities with her clients. This decision is very purposeful on her part. She’s fulfilling a need they have, and she’s not just treating them as another number on her account.&nbsp;

“I love their lives. I love to know where they’re from, and they love hearing about my life as well.”&nbsp;

I want to thank Hong for joining me today. If you’d like to talk more about applying leadership lessons to client care or you want to learn how to structure a team or partnership to help you achieve your business goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
