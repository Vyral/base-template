I’m here to announce a transition in my career. I’m leaving Guardian Mortgage, but I’m staying in the business.

I’ve got some huge news to share with you today. After 14 wonderful years with Guardian Mortgage, I have decided to pursue a different opportunity. I can’t thank Guardian enough for thirty years of support in my career, and I will forever be in their debt. I’m not getting out of the business, however, so if I can help you going forward, I would love to do so. My number isn’t changing, but my new team email is [TheBetzTeam@WinningWithWade.com](mailto:TheBetzTeam@WinningWithWade.com) and personal email is [Wade@WinningWithWade.com](mailto:Wade@WinningWithWade.com).

If you have any questions for me about this transition or about anything related to the mortgage world, always feel free to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.
