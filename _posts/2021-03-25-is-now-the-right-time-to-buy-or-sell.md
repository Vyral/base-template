<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what could happen to your home affordability by waiting to buy.</em></center>

When deciding whether now is the right time to buy or sell a home, it’s important to consider the interest rates. **The cost of waiting to purchase a home or refinance your current home loan could be significant if rates increase.** Every 1% increase in rates causes you to lose 10% in purchasing power. If you qualify for $300,000 today, you could only afford a $270,000 house if rates went up 1%. Timing is everything, and you could see your monthly payment drop hundreds if you make your move quickly while rates are still low.&nbsp;

We understand that making decisions about your home is a big deal, and we don’t take that lightly. Our team of local experts stays up to date on market trends and gives you the resources you need to make the best decisions on when to refinance, buy, or sell a home.

If you have any questions for me about buying, selling, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
