Today, our home advisor, Dulci Clark, is sharing with us how her real estate career started and how she came to be a part of our team.

Her journey started about two and a half years ago, during the pandemic. She was a dental hygienist for 22 years, but thought that she needed something different for her life. One day, she went home and told her husband she was taking some real estate classes.&nbsp;

Those classes ended right around the time when everything shut down during the pandemic. She took the test, passed, and jumped right into real estate. This was exciting for Dulci, but the crazy market at that time and going from a regular paycheck to full commission proved to be challenging for her. Also, her previous career was nothing like working in real estate, so it was quite the adjustment.&nbsp;

At some point, she was told by another agent that she was a liability. That triggered something in her, which made her decide she needed training and accountability. **She wanted to be the best agent that she could be, so she reached out to the Dave Hook team.&nbsp;**

Her best friend advised her to get on a team at Keller Williams, so she contacted Dave, and she says it has been the best move she ever made. Now Dulci gets to work with like-minded individuals who have the same goals and passions as her. She wants to enrich people's lives and help them buy and sell homes.&nbsp;

Throughout the two years she has been with the team, one of her passions has always been educating and helping first-time homebuyers get into their new home. In the future, she’d like to continue to help enrich as many lives as possible through real estate and be the best person that she can be for those she comes in contact with.&nbsp;
