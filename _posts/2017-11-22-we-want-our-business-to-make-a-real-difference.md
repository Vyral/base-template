I just got back from a conference called “Thrive,” which I’ve attended for the past few years. The basic concept is that making money matters. This conference really emphasizes the importance of **making money to make a difference, instead of just to supplement an extravagant quality of life.**

Making money to give back to the community or to a certain cause can have a great impact. This is something I have personally tried to do for quite some time now. I make a strong effort to be giving in one way or another.

For this reason, we’ve shifted to a “for purpose” business. This means that **a percentage of what we make will go to specific causes each quarter.**

This year, we’ll be giving nearly $20,000 towards helping orphans in Mexico. I’m actually going to go myself to provide some hands-on help. Though I’m not yet experienced with this kind of philanthropy, it just feels right.

The support I’ve received from my clients has allowed me to build a sustainable career, which is all the more reason for me to give back. **I want to seek out opportunities and causes that will truly have an impact.**

If there are any causes you think are really worthwhile, please let me know. More than anything, I want to thank you for allowing me to be in a position to give back.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
