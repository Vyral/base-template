For your latest North San Diego County market update, let’s look at the key statistics from last May and how they compare to the previous month:

* The median price increased $35,000 to $730,000. This means more homes are selling at a higher price and the median value of homes is trending upward.
* The average days on market dropped from 37 days to 31 days. This means, in addition to selling at a higher price, homes are also selling quicker.
* The housing supply increased 0.1 months to three months—in other words, if no new homes came on the market, it would take three months to sell all available inventory.
* The total number of home sales dropped from 1,010 to 910.
* The average interest rate for a conventional 30-year fixed rate dropped 0.02% to 3.82%. This is a big reason why homes values are going up and the average days on market is going down.&nbsp;

These statistics are for detached homes only, but in general, **more buyers are entering the market, values are being driven up, and more homes are selling and selling quicker.** It’s a great time to be a seller, but because interest rates are so low, it’s also a great time to be a buyer.&nbsp;
