Today I just wanted to chime in real quick about getting out of production. I know that this is a dream for so many of us, where we get to say that we’re out of production. However, the truth is that you will never truly be out of production until you sell off your business and have nothing to do with it anymore. **As long as you are the owner of the company, there’s always a chance that you’ll have to dip your toe back into production.**

Everyone's striving for these big production numbers, but sometimes their bank account suffers and their profit is dismal. When we plan our own business, run our own lives, and set our own goals, **we need to remember that we must run our real estate business like a business.** This means watching our P+L and our bottom line.

We’re solely responsible for the business. If that means getting back “into” production after you’ve been out of it for a while, that’s OK. **You’re not betraying your goals by doing that.** You’re just taking ownership of the bottom line like you should be. Sometimes you might have to jump in every once in a while. That’s how you built your business, right?

Of course, our businesses are all unique and always changing, but the goal is to be profitable and do what you love. If you have any questions for me or need anything in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
