When you’re in the market to buy a home, you can choose between new construction and resale homes, which are homes that have been previously lived in. But which is the better option? Today I’ll list the pros and cons of both new construction and resale homes to help you make an informed decision.

**New Construction:**

Pros:

* Customizable layout and design
* New amenities&nbsp;
* Energy efficiency
* Home warranties
* Higher resale value
* Fewer home repairs

Cons:

* Higher price
* HOA fees
* Less charm
* Limited negotiation room
* Extensive landscaping

**Resale Homes:**

Pros:

* More styles to choose from
* Many repairs have already been made
* Lower in price
* Landscaping is fully grown
* Faster buying time

Cons:

* Homes are typically smaller
* Less energy efficient
* Require more maintenance
* Contain older appliances
* Fewer accessibility features
* Questionable coverages.

Regardless of whether you buy a new construction or resale home, the process will require plenty of research, patience, and compromise. Making a checklist of your must-have features will help you identify what you can’t live without.
