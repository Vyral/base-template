I recently sat down for a Zoom call with loan officer Shane Hoffman of Edina Realty Mortgage (whom you may recognize from some of our previous videos) to discuss interest rates, mortgage forbearance, and more.&nbsp;

In the wake of COVID-19, the mortgage world has been subject to daily changes, and it can be a challenge to stay updated if you’re a potential buyer or refinancer. The good news? If you need to buy a home amid this health crisis, or if you’ve had to enroll in a mortgage forbearance and are afraid it will haunt you forever, it’s not the end of the world—as Shane explains, there are still plenty of financing options available.&nbsp;
