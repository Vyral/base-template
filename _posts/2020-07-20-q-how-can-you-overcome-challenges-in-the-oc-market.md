<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a story about how I made a negative experience positive.</em></center>

&nbsp;

About five years ago, I flew into Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. It’s an airport notorious for delays and cancellations of flights. My story is not very different. When we arrived at the airport, there was a delay at the gate and I missed my connecting flight, the last flight of the evening. I ended up sleeping in the airport. I was extremely frustrated and upset.

Last year, I flew out of West Palm Beach and, after mechanical issues, I missed my next connecting flight. In the second instance, though, I realized that no matter how frustrated I was, there was nothing I could do to fix it at the moment. I called the airline, and we found a flight that flew into LA from Miami. So I drove about an hour to Miami via Uber and eventually made my flight from Miami to LA. I ended up getting home before I would have arrived home originally.

Right now, there are many parallels to this story and our real estate market. We can’t change the challenges that have arisen during the pandemic, but we can change the way we deal with them and come up with unique solutions to these problems.&nbsp;

**We have an extreme seller’s market in most price points.** At this time last year, there were over 6,000 homes on the market. Today, there are 61% fewer homes available. Homes are selling with multiple offers and well above asking price right now if priced correctly. For our sellers, we follow a four-phase process to maximize their sale price and ensure we don’t leave any money on the table.&nbsp;

We've also been able to help buyers win. We are helping them find homes that are overpriced and not marketed well, and make opportunities out of them. **Both of the accepted offers we had this last week were actually below asking price.**

If you have any real estate needs, we can help you come up with the right strategy to reach your goals. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
