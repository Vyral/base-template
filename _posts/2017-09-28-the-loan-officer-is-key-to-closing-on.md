We’re excited to announce our partnership with Chris Motal from Loan Depot. After all, the loan officer is a key player in your real estate purchase.

When you purchase residential real estate, the lender or loan officer you work with can be very important.

When you sign an agreement to buy a piece of property from a seller, you are agreeing to a roadmap. The purchase agreement says that you are going to do all of the critical things from the inspection to the appraisal in order to close on a certain date.

In my opinion, the lender is the most important person in this process. We are here to guide you through this process and help you but ultimately, **closing is up to the lender or loan officer.**

That’s why I couldn’t be more excited to introduce you to our new partnership with Chris Motal of Loan Depot. Chris is going to serve alongside us and help our clients.

Even if you have already bought a house, Chris and his team can help you. If you plan on making some changes, renovations, or remodeling, let Chris and his team know. He has an amazing product suite that you can use to fulfill any of your dreams.

Whether you are moving up, down, or across town, let Chris know. “I have a great loan product that’s perfect for this market with great rates and a low fee structure,” says Chris. “And I’ve got one that I’m really proud of: a zero down VA renovation mortgage.”

If you are a veteran and want to buy a home with zero down, **you can get the home of your dreams as well as up to $35,000 to renovate the property before you move in.**
