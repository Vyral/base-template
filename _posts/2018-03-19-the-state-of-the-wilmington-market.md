Just like our clocks for Daylight Saving Time, the Wilmington real estate market is expected to spring forward in the coming months.&nbsp;

Typically in the wintertime, we have a lull where there’s a lack of inventory and a lack of buyers. We expect an influx of sellers and buyers coming onto the market over the next couple of months.

If you’ve been thinking about selling your home, **now would be a great time to put it on the market.** Interest rates are rising, but they’re still near historic lows, so with time, your purchasing power will be affected. Listing now will help you **beat out other competition to the market.**
