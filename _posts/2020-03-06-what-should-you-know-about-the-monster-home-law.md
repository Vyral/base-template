The new monster home law just passed in Hawaii. **It states that if a home’s size takes up 60% or more of the lot, you’re going to have some new specific guidelines on how to build to.** You can read more about them in the building department’s new requirements for monster homes.

This law has just been changed after already having been changed last year. **With the latest change, monster homes are going to be much harder to build, both legally and illegally.** There are now penalties that will be put on builders who build monster homes occupying more than 60% of the lot size and containing more than six bedrooms.&nbsp;
