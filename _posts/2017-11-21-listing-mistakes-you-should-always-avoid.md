A lot goes into the process of selling your home. That being said, there are a lot of things you should avoid. Today, we want to go over some of the biggest mistakes people can make when selling their homes.

**First off is asking too much money for your property. Even in a seller’s market, this can be a mistake people make.**

Our market is experiencing a slight shift, so overpricing can become very frustrating for everyone involved in the transaction. Listing your home too high will only lead to price reduction after price reduction.

**The next mistake sellers commonly make is advertising too little.** There tends to be an assumption that just because you’ve hired a Realtor, you’re in the clear.

The truth is that merely putting your home on the market and waiting isn’t enough. You will need a detailed marketing strategy to expose your home to the most buyers possible.

The last mistake we’d like to talk about is **not preparing your home adequately for sale.** Once a home is on the market, it is no longer just a place to live in. A home that’s listed on the market needs to be ready at a moment’s notice for buyers to view it. More than just the home you once lived in, your property is a showcase for what buyers can expect.
