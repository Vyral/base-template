Last year, we didn’t have any firework shows due to COVID-19. Over the last month, a lot of the [traditional firework shows](https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/july-4-fireworks-2021-los-angeles/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around L.A. have been scheduled at places like the Hollywood Bowl, the Rose Bowl, and Disneyland. Our pick for the best spot to check out 4th of July fireworks in the SFV this year is Shepherd Church in Porter Ranch. For all the details about the event, check out&nbsp;[this link.](https://www.shepherdchurch.com/4th){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} To hear my full message, watch this short video.
