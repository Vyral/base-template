Moving is a huge undertaking, but relocating can add a new layer of stress and planning to the process. Today I want to share 10 tips to help make your relocation a success:

**1\. Visit your new city before moving.** This way, you can get a feel for the layout and culture. It will also help you get an idea of the cost of living in the area.&nbsp;

**2\. Make a list of what you want in a new home.** Once you have everything written out, give it to your agent so they can help you achieve your goals.&nbsp;

**3\. Get rid of unnecessary items.** Packing is the perfect time to ditch all the junk you no longer use. Separate things into a donate and trash pile so that you don’t waste anything someone else could use.&nbsp;

**4\. Ask your agent to help you find free or inexpensive moving boxes.** They might have connections to help you save some money.&nbsp;

**5\. Carefully label moving boxes.** This will make unpacking much smoother.&nbsp;

**6\. Pack a necessities box for each person and room.** They’ll be the last boxes packed at the old house and the first ones unpacked at the new home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**7\. Shop around for good movers.** Ask your agent if they have a good referral so that you end up with someone reliable.&nbsp;

**8\. Cancel delivery services and change your address.** Don’t forget to transfer your utilities, either.&nbsp;

**9\. If you’re moving for a job, get to know your new co-workers.** This is a great way to meet new people and learn your area.&nbsp;

**10\. Use your Realtor as a resource.** A good agent can be a great guide for schools, shopping, neighborhoods, and more.&nbsp;
