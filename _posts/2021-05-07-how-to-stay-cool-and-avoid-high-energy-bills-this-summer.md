Here are some simple ways to keep your energy costs low this summer.

As South Carolina temperatures rise, so do our monthly energy bills. Here are a few tips to help you stay cool and keep those costs low.

**Maximizing the efficiency of your cooling system is vital to reducing your energy bills.** Clearing out an A/C filter can save you 5% to 15% on your energy bills and keep you from needing costly repairs.

The easiest way to cut down on energy costs is to be outdoors. Cutting back on the use of lights, A/C, water hearing, and cooking will save you more money throughout the day.&nbsp;

Rather than turning off your electronics when not in use, consider completely unplugging them if possible. **Most electronics continue to consume energy even when they aren’t turned on.**

Fans won’t decrease the temps in a room, but air circulation is a must for hot days. Remember to close doors and A/C vents in rooms you’re not using. You can easily save money by conserving energy for the rooms that you’re in.

By implementing these tips, you'll save on your energy bills this summer. If you have any questions or are ready to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
