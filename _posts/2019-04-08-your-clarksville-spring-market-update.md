Since December 2015, our market has been highly active, and it seems to only be getting more active by the day.&nbsp;

The scarce inventory that characterizes the market landscape nationally is also affecting us on the local level—**at this moment, we have just 790 active listings; that’s the lowest inventory has been since I’ve lived here!** That’s a decrease of 7.49% when compared to inventory levels at this time last year.&nbsp;

Last year, the number of closings by this time reached 1,092, while 2019’s current total is 1,072. This amounts to a 1.83% drop, year over year. In all likelihood, this can be attributed to our limited inventory.&nbsp;

Now, let’s look at the average sale price. In 2018, the average home sold for $187,600, and this stat point is trending upward in 2019. **To date, homes in our area are selling for $199,600 on average, which is a 6.4% climb.**&nbsp;

In 2019, the average home is spending fewer days on market by a very slight margin—we’re currently at 51 days, compared to 53 days the year before.&nbsp;

**I often hear that we’re in a hot seller’s market, and while this is true for some price ranges, it isn’t necessarily so for others.&nbsp;**

For the $180,000 to $240,000 price range, there’s currently about a month and 20 days’ worth of inventory. As for homes priced in the $100,000 to $180,000 range, we have just 23 days’ worth of supply. Homes in the $240,000 to $300,000 price range are at four months of inventory. And in the upper-level price points, supply is at nine months or more. &nbsp;

**As you can see, the Clarksville market is buzzing with activity.** If you’re looking to sell your home, there’s much to gain from our current market conditions. And buyers who are keen to find a home should heed the advice of their Realtor in order to outshine the competition.&nbsp;
