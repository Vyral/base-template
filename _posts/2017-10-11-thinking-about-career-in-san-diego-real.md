Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?
<a href="mailto:JTaylor@kw.com">Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.</a>

If you want to grow your database and your real estate business, most agents know that there are two ways you can go about it: **prospecting or marketing.**

Most new agents focus on prospecting. They do open houses, knock on doors, make cold calls, and call expired listings and for sale by owner properties. They go out and find the business.

**Most top agents focus on marketing.** Typically 80% or more of a top agent’s business comes from marketing. They get past clients, repeat business, and referrals.

What do they do to market? I have the answer here.
