Before saying, “You’re hired,” when interviewing a real estate agent to represent you, you’ll want to be sure they possess the hallmarks of a worthy candidate. To that end, today I’m sharing three questions you should ask any potential hire:

1. **What is your list-to-sales-price ratio?** In our local market, this figure varies considerably—it could be anywhere from 93% to 95%. On average, our team’s ratio is at about 97%, which means we’re helping sellers net 2% to 4% more on their sale.
2. **What are you going to do differently to get my home sold?** Get an idea of the kind of unique touch they’ll give to marketing your home. It’s not enough for them to simply put your home on the MLS, stick a sign in your front yard, and hold an open house. You need to know, in no uncertain terms, what they’ll do to sell your home with a high degree of competency.
3. **How many homes have you sold so far this year?** Believe or not, the average agent has sold a paltry total of three homes on the year. Unlike the average agent, we at the Roth Team have sold 200 homes and counting in 2019.
