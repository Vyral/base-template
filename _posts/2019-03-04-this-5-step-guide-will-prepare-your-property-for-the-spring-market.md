<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you getting ready to sell this spring? If so, follow these five tips to get your house ready for the market.</em></p>

With spring just around the corner, many homeowners have begun planning to put their property up for sale. After all, the coming months constitute one of the hottest times of year to list.&nbsp;

If you’re among those planning a spring sale, there are a few steps you can take now to prepare.

First of all, you need to stop thinking of your house as your home. If your sale goes as planned, after all, the property will soon belong to someone new—so you need to treat it as such.

With that said, let’s move on to today’s tips:

**1. Let the light in.** Properties show best when they’re well lit.

**2. Make necessary updates.** You don’t need to gut the whole house, but partnering with your agent to target and complete any necessary upgrades will make a world of difference in your selling success.&nbsp;

**3. Apply fresh paint.** Fresh paint brings some of the highest return on investment of any home upgrade you can do. Remember to stick to neutral colors, though.&nbsp;

**4. Make necessary repairs**. If there is anything broken within your home, now is the time to fix it. Anything a home inspector might find should be resolved before they have the chance to point them out.&nbsp;

**5. Clean the home and eliminate odors.** If you’re a smoker or have pets, you may not notice the associated odors that can come as a result. However, buyers certainly will, so now is the time to give your home a good, thorough cleaning. Your home should be spotless by the time buyers set foot inside.&nbsp;
