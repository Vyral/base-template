Your employer brand is just as important (if not more important) than the product and the services you provide as an organization. Companies that attract top talent are the ones that have a proactive approach to strengthening their employer brand.

There are three specific tools you can use to strengthen your brand as an employer to attract top talent:

1. **Glassdoor.com:** This is a community where current employees can rate their employer. They can rate the CEO, the interview process, the CEO's vision for the company, and the company as a whole. Good, bad, right, or wrong, employees can leave feedback, and as a prospect, this is one of the first places you want to look to see if it's an organization you want to work for. Companies who do this well take a proactive approach to commenting on this feedback. Commenting on feedback shows that you care as an organization and that you take this feedback seriously and want to improve.
2. **Utilize social media:**Most companies have a website to showcase themselves as employers, but companies that do very well with branding have other avenues. To attract top talent, organizations should have a company Facebook page, Twitter handle, and YouTube channel to give updates and showcase the culture. This could include awards you've won or fun things going on.
3. **A company LinkedIn page:** This falls under social media as well, but it's also where a lot of talent is and where they spend a lot of time. Your company LinkedIn page should always be up to date with current openings as well as company news. Keep it relevant to stay ahead of the curve.
