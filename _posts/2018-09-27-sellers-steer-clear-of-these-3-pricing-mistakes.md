Over the years I’ve talked with a lot of sellers whose listings failed to move off the market. And, in talking to these sellers, there were six mistakes I noticed across the board. I’ll share three of them here, but feel free to reach out to me directly if you’d like to hear the rest.

**1. Pricing the home based on what you paid for it.** The market in which any given seller purchased their home was almost certainly a far cry from the market they will attempt to sell it in. That said, trying to base a list price on what the home cost is a major mistake.

**2. Pricing the home based on what you need.** Realistically, no one cares if you want to buy a $30,000 boat using the proceeds from your home sale. Buyers will only pay what the home is truly worth.

**3. Pricing based on what your neighbors say.** Your neighbor doesn’t understand your property or market conditions. Getting the opinion of a licensed real estate professional is the best way to truly understand your home’s value.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to hear the three remaining seller mistakes I’ve noticed over the years, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
