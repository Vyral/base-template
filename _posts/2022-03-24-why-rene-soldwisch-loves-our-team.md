Today we want to share a clip from an interview we had with Rene Soldwisch, Misty’s sister-in-law. She’s been in real estate for a little over eight years. Before that, she was in mortgage lending, interior decorating, and even the radio business. Her skills all came together when she started as an agent, contributing to her success. We asked her a few questions about the industry:

**What do you like most about real estate?**

The people. I love to help people achieve their goals and find their dream home. Some clients cry tears of joy when they find that perfect house, and being a part of that is a big deal. That home is where they’re going to live and make memories.

**What are the biggest obstacles for buyers and sellers?**

They want to make sure they’re getting a good deal and doing the right thing. I work with all kinds of buyers, and I help guide them toward the right decision and alleviate their concerns. Buying a home is a big investment for most.

**What’s the best part about working on Misty’s team?&nbsp;**

We’re very unique. We fit together very well as a team. We have each other’s back, and we keep each other positive. Misty is a great leader, and many other agents don’t have that sort of guidance; they’re just floundering. If one of us has a question, there’s a plethora of information at our fingertips.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our team or real estate in general, feel free to call or email us. We’d love to help.
