Our real estate team has been servicing the Baltimore Metro area for the last 30 years or so. Although we’re based out of Columbia, we will go anywhere in the state of Maryland that they’ll let us sell homes for our clients.

Harford County has always been an area that we’ve serviced, but it’s to the point where it’s an hour or so away from us. **So, to better service our clients on that side of town, we have recently partnered with Rob Elliot.** Rob is a Bel Air and Fallston area native, and we’re really excited to combine our resources with Rob’s local knowledge and expertise on that side of town.

“I am excited to be a part of this team,” says Rob. “I have been a Baltimore County and Harford County resident for 47 years, and my wife and my three children reside in Bel Air. I’ve been in sales most of my adult life, and I’ve been in the real estate market as an investor. I made the decision to work with clients to help them find homes, and I look forward to working with you.”

**We are lucky to have Rob as part of our team.** If you would like to meet Rob, he is having a client event on Sunday, February 25 at Horizon Cinemas in Fallston at 9:30 a.m. There will be a screening of the movie “Peter Rabbit,” as well as some free breakfast (bagels, donuts, and coffee).

Come on out on February 25 for a great time. We will send out Facebook invitations and other invites soon.

Again, thanks to Rob for joining our team. We look forward to working with him.

As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
