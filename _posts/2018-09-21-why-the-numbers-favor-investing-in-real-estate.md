<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Real estate is a great avenue to invest your money in, and today I’ll show you the numbers that prove why.</em></p>

To show you the benefits of investing in real estate, I want to go over the spreadsheet numbers of a property we recently purchased as part of a long-term hold strategy.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the video above so you can jump ahead to the sections(s) that interest you the most:**

2:16 - Getting into the numbers from our spreadsheet.<br>2:51 - The importance of having a model and having non-negotiable standards for anything you purchase.&nbsp;<br>3:35 - Our purchase price, down payment, interest rate, capital improvement costs, closing costs, and mortgage costs.<br>5:15 - Our monthly rent and net rental income.&nbsp;<br>6:05 - Home warranty costs, other maintenance fees, and our net cash flow per month.&nbsp;<br>7:15 - Our cash-on-cash return and cap rate.&nbsp;<br>7:49 - How your cash-on-cash return grows over time.&nbsp;

We’d be happy to share this spreadsheet with you, so if you’d like a copy of it so you can start playing around with the numbers, just let me know.&nbsp;
