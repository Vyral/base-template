We’ve got some great news to share about our great city. Charleston has recently been ranked the number two most popular destination for movers in 2016. **The three contributing factors to this are strong job growth, low vacancy rates, and high affordability.**

For us in Charleston, this means a few things. For one, more people are moving to the area. That’s obvious. We have 43 newcomers each day on average. Jobs will also continue to grow, as the Charleston region is ranked in the top-10 in the U.S. for job seekers.

**If you own a Charleston home, its value has likely risen.** The median sales price is 11.4% higher right now than it was at the same time last year.
