I was recently at a training conference with other Realtors. At one point during the presentation, the energy took a nosedive because of the content the presenter was giving. **They were talking about all the required fundamentals that Realtors must deploy daily in order to have a sexy, luxurious life.**

In my years of talking with and recruiting agents, almost everybody wants to get into the business for what I call the three F's: freedom, flexibility, and finances. All of these are great reasons to get into real estate. In fact, most of your mega-agents have these, but it comes at the cost of doing unsexy things.

My 10-year-old son wants to be a great soccer player, but he's not all in on the fundamentals like drills and practice. Until he commits to these soccer fundamentals, he wonâ€™t be playing up to his potential.

We covered these unsexy real estate fundamentals in a previous video. These activities are mundane and monotonous. However, when we do them at a high level, we start living the life we want. If you have any questions or would like to set up a 30-minute consultation to dive into your business, please call, text, or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
