There are two important things sellers sometimes forget to research when listing their homes that you shouldn’t forget about when it’s time for you to put your home on the market.

The first is **the average days on market for homes in your area**, or how long the average home takes to sell in your neighborhood.

The second thing you shouldn’t forget to research is **the supply and demand in your area**. If supply is low in your area, you might be able to sell your home at a higher price. If supply is high, you might get a little less than what you’re expecting.
