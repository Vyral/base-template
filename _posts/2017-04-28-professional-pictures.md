When is the best time to take exterior photos of your home? How should you stage the exterior so that your listing stands out to potential buyers?

Your listing photos are key to a successful home sale. When it comes to exterior photos, you should make sure those are taken when your house looks its best.

**It’s important that you plan ahead for exterior photos.** Make repairs to the outside of your home, cut down any trees you’ve been wanting to get rid of, and consider power washing or painting your home.

Now that it’s spring, your home probably looks really good right now. We offer to do a free video and photoshoot of your home, and we can come over after your landscapers are done to take some great photos and video for your listing.

We use a flip camera or iPad to film your home; that way, we can post your listing to social media right away. Make sure that you work with a Realtor who is tied into social media.

If you aren’t planning on selling your home quite yet, we can post your listing photos to our ‘Coming Soon’ listings page on our website. For example, if you are selling your house in the fall, odds are your buyer needs to sell their current home before they can purchase a new one. **Move-up buyers use ‘Coming Soon’ listings to secure housing after their home sale.**

These are just a few of the top tips that I like to share at our Home Selling Sharks Seminars. Visit <a href="http://homesellingsharks.com/" target="_blank">HomeSellingSharks.com</a> to sign up for our next monthly seminar. In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
