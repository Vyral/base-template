Closing costs seem to be somewhat of a mystery to many. These are essentially additional fees (outside of the down payment) that are associated with the purchase of a home. Today we’ll be using a program to calculate example payments you’ll find in your closing costs.

**You can follow along with the video example starting at 00:35.**

For the example, let’s say the purchase price is $250,000 with a 10% down payment, an interest rate of 4.99%, and a 30-year conventional mortgage loan. There is also a 1.1% cost for hazard insurance and 1.12% for taxes.

After the numbers are crunched, the total closing costs (not including the $25,000 down payment) are $7,379.06. **This amount is broken down into prepaid costs, title fees, lender fees, and other fees.**

**Prepaid costs** are incurred by the buyer after closing and include insurance, escrow, and some interest. **Title fees** facilitate the closing of the property and provide protection for the buyer, and include title policies, closing fees, attorneys, GAP coverage, and more. **Lender fees** ensure the home is in good shape and include appraisals, inspections, and surveys.

These are the costs you’ll be paying when you purchase a home. If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
