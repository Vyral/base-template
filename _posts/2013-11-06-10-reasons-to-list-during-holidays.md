With the holiday season here, everyone wants to know whether now is the time to list their home or wait until the spring. The right time really depends on your situation. What are your needs?

Selling during the winter months is a great idea. In fact, I have 10 reasons why you can be confident that your home will sell if you list now.

1. People looking for a home during the Holiday season are usually serious buyers.

2. Serious buyers have fewer houses to choose from during the Holidays. Less competition means more bargaining power for you!

3. Since the supply of listings will increase dramatically in January, your home will face more competition after the holidays which means less money for you!

4. Houses often show better when tastefully decorated for the Holidays.

5. Buyers are more emotional during the Holidays. They are more likely to pay your price!

6. Buyers have more time to look for a home during the Holidays than they do during the typical working time of year.

7. For tax reasons, some people must buy before the end of the year.

8. January is traditionally the month for employees to begin new jobs. Since they would prefer to buy now rather than wait until the spring, your home has first shot at these new buyers.

9. If your home sells during the Holidays we can provide a delayed closing and/or a post-settlement occupancy agreement to give you more time in the home if you need it.

10. By selling during the Holidays you are perfectly positioned to be a fully qualified buyer in Spring, when many more homes are on the market for less money. You actually can sell higher and buy lower by selling over the Holidays and buying in the Spring.

These are just  few good reasons to list your home during the holidays. [You can download the 10 Reason to List During the Holidays here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8HGlkyWTsqlMXRYbS0tSDZJRlE/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks for watching!
