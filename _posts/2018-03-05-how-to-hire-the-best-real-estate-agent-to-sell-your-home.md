There are five common mistakes that sellers make when they hire a listing agent, and I wanted to bring them to your attention today.&nbsp;

**1. They hire the agent who quotes them the highest price.** Remember, we’re not the buyer, so we’re not going to quote a price for your home; we’re simply the agent who is going to market your house. When an agent wants to win a listing, sometimes they will quote a price that’s higher than the market value. This price is often completely unrealistic, but the agent knows that they will get to put a “For Sale” sign in your yard. Buyers will start calling the sign and the agent will get new leads, knowing that down the line, they can suggest a price reduction.&nbsp;

Remember, homes that are priced properly to begin with sell faster and for more money than overpriced homes. I have some local studies that support that statement if you would like more information.&nbsp;

**2. Hiring an agent just because they are a friend of family member.**This isn’t always a bad thing, because you obviously want a connection with your agent. Still, it’s important to do some homework to find out if they are a top producing agent. Sometimes, these agents might have just gotten their license or only sell three or four homes a year. If that’s the case, then they are not the best person to market your house to get top dollar. It’s fine to hire a friend or family member; just make sure they are a qualified real estate agent first.

**3. They view all agents as being equal.** I’ve been in this industry a long time, and I can tell you that not all agents are equal. Some are part-time agents. They may have the same licenses as I do, but they don’t do the same marketing, offer the same service, or have the same expertise as I do. You have to do your homework on the agent’s background and statistics to find out what they are about. You want to find the agent who will get you the most money for your house and give you the best service and expert advice along the way.&nbsp;

**4. They are in too much of a rush.** Sometimes, you might only be in town for a day. If you didn’t plan ahead, you’ll need to meet an agent right away. If you hire the first agent who’s available, you probably won’t end up with the best agents. The agents who are available at a moment’s notice don’t have anything else going on. They might be a newly licensed agent or a new agent on a team who got stuck with taking all the phone calls. You need to plan ahead and hire an agent who has a lot of other clients. These agents are more experienced and are in the market everyday, so they will be better able to help you buy or sell a house.&nbsp;

**5. They don’t do their homework.**I’ve mentioned it a couple of times already, but you have to research an agent before you hire them. &nbsp;Check out their reviews on Facebook, Google, or Zillow. If an agent only has two or three five-star agents, keep looking—they might have asked a couple friends to leave them a review. Find an agent with an extensive history and a lot of good reviews from a number of clients over a long period of time.&nbsp;

As you can see, it’s important to avoid these mistakes if you want to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. If you have any other questions about selling your home or real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!<br>&nbsp;
