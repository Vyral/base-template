Are the rumors true? Have we decided to branch out into property management? Well, I’ve got some exciting news to share with you.

You may have been wondering—are the rumors true? Are we doing property management? **I’m excited to announce that we have opened up a second brokerage that will focus on strictly managing rental properties for clients.** We’ve named our sister company Iron Horse Property Management.

I had clients come to me for years asking me to branch out into property management, and I was always hesitant because my main focus was on sales. I wanted to be great at sales and make that the main focus of Woodall Realty Group.

Now I feel like the timing is better than it was in the past. The reason for this is our sales team is staffed with four full-time agents in addition to myself, our systems and processes are really dialed in, and we helped over 200 families last year. We expect to help even more families this year, and our business is steady enough that I felt we could finally branch out into property management.

A big concern that I've had was that I didn’t have the time during the day to focus on the daily aspects of moving tenants in, handling repairs, moving tenants out, and all the things that come along with property management. **My solution was to find and hire a great property manager who has years of experience and, in my opinion, is one of the best in Athens, Jennifer McMahon.**

Jennifer has worked with two other property managers in Athens over the years and has done a great job. She’s a go-getter, a hard worker, and she will be handling the day-to-day aspects of the property management. She’ll be taking care of all of the things that you as a landlord don’t want to do and help things run more smoothly.

**So, now we will be able to offer the same great service through Iron Horse Property Management that you get through Woodall Realty Group.** If you have rental property that you’re managing yourself, or you’re dissatisfied with your current property management, give me or Jennifer a call.

**Our goal with Iron Horse Property Management is to give you peace of mind while maximizing the return on your investment.** We want to make owning rental property a completely passive investment for you so that you just receive income each month and not have to worry about it.

If you or someone you know has questions about Iron Horse Property Management or any other concerns, give us a call. We would love to be here for you.
