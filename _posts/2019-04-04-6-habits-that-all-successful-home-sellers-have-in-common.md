To achieve a fast and fruitful home sale, most sellers have certain key habits in common. Today, we’ll be covering six of the most critical: 

Tidy up every day. Keeping your home consistently neat and clean will make showings much less stressful. 


Generate buzz about your listing on a weekly basis. Make it your mission to collaborate with your agent and their team to broadcast far and wide that your home is for sale. This means hosting open houses, posting about your home on social media, and even just telling your friends about your listing. 


Deep clean your home each week. Beyond the daily tidying up you do, you should also do a more thorough cleaning every week. Deep cleaning your home inside and out will make it shine and help attract more buyers. 

Maintain your exterior by checking it over each month. Even before you list, you should pay careful attention to how your home’s curb appeal looks. If there is any chipping paint, if your doorknob is loose, or if your landscaping looks worse for wear, take the time to spruce things up. You can even create a checklist for outdoor maintenance to ensure no detail flies under your radar.

Sit down and strategize with your Realtor each month. Getting in the habit of having a monthly review meeting with your agent while your home is on the market is a great idea. Checking in like this will help to ensure that your strategy for selling your home stays fresh over time. 


Go over your home’s overall condition on an annual basis. Regardless of whether you’re planning to sell or not, doing a once-yearly checkup of your home’s general condition will help you stay on top of maintenance. Doing this can also prevent major issues from going unnoticed.
