Today I’m joined by my team member and special guest Anya Hageman, CEO of Red Settlement Services, to go over some tips to help sellers achieve smoother transactions.

Anya has been in real estate for 18 years. During that time, she’s worked in a number of different roles and has closed a total of around 10,000 transactions. In other words, she knows a thing or two about closing smoothly. Let’s take a look at some tips she recommends:

**1. Locate your abstract.**&nbsp;An abstract is, essentially, the “biography” of a house. Before you even list your house, you should find your abstract and send it to your Realtor.

**2. Fill out your mortgage release authorization.** You must complete this form to the best of your knowledge before your payoff can be ordered.

**3. Be prepared.** Anything can happen. During any real estate transaction, you need to consider the possibility of the unexpected. The real estate professionals you work with may help you through whatever unforeseen circumstances arise, but you must be timely in communicating any developments with them.

**4. Work with a professional.&nbsp;**There’s a reason there are Realtors in this world. Working with a team of professionals during your real estate process will be a big help in getting you to the closing table as seamlessly as possible.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
