Happy fall!

Now that the season has changed, it’s time to look back on our market and update you on what’s happening now.

In short, we had a phenomenal summer. **Interest rates dropped back down to historic lows, and buyers are out there still buying away.**

At the moment, properties are moving off the shelves in the lower and medium-priced markets. There’s a bit of a softening in the higher-end markets, but homes are still very much in demand.

If you have any questions about our LA market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
