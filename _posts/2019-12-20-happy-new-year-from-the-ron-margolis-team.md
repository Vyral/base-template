Aloha\! On behalf of my EXP Realty team on the beautiful Garden Island, I wanted to take the time to say thank you for trusting us with your real estate goals. **We’re grateful for the opportunity to be of service.&nbsp;**

My team and I work hard so that buying or selling real estate can be easy for you. We do our best to understand what your property needs and wants are.&nbsp;

We’re always grateful to share our resources with you, whether that connecting you with an electrician, handyman, or a plumber. **If you want to plug into the community and give back through one of our many nonprofits, we know a lot about that and we’d love to share that as well.&nbsp;**

As we move into the new year, I’d like for you to tell me if there’s a specific topic or question you’d like to know more about. Not only will I incorporate it into one of my videos, but we’ll also send you a little gift for your question.&nbsp;

We want to wish you a safe, healthy, happy and prosperous new year—we’ll see you in 2020\!&nbsp;

At 2:00 in the video above, you’ll be able to see personalized messages from my team members Bailey Hutton and Gwen Margolis.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about real estate in general, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you any way I can. Hauʻoli makahiki hou\!
