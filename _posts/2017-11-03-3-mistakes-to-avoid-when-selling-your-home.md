Today we’d like to educate you about three mistakes to avoid making when you sell your home.

The first is asking for too much for the price of your home. Logically, we understand why a seller would want to ask for more money than the market could bear. It is common for people to want to negotiate downwards and have more room to work with. **But, the market conditions will dictate how aggressive you can feasibly be on price**. You need to start with a bird’s-eye view of the market.

It doesn’t necessarily mean you want to start high with the intention of giving yourself more room, and here’s why: **The longer you sit on the market, the less you stand to make**. There’s a lower sense of urgency from buyers when they see that you’ve been on the market for an extended period of time. They start asking the wrong questions—what’s wrong with it? How much money can I get from it?

**It’s much better to give it the perception of value by positioning it correctly with the right price point**. That way, the buyers will begin asking the right questions—how many other people are looking at this house? How quickly will this house sell?

**Additionally, you have to realize that buyers are savvy**. They have access to most of the information that a real estate professional is going to have. They know to watch the days on market and are getting updates when you reduce the price.

The second is not being flexible. The seller might think that the price they’ve listed their home at is what they should get for the property, and if they get a solid offer that is a little under the range they’re asking for, they’re not willing to budge. This could lose them the offer. **Remember, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush**. You need to try to get as much as possible from the offer that stands or risk losing it and other potential offers. It’s good to have a win-win mindset.

The third mistake to avoid is not making sure that your house is presentable. Marketing a house comes down to three things: **location, price, and condition**. We can’t control location, but that still leaves you with two controllable factors. Your price, which we’ve discussed, should match your condition. Sometimes, all it takes is a little work.

Staging is a huge part of presentation with today’s pool of buyers. This can take some money (which we try to minimize that as much as possible) and also a little bit of work to get it to the point where the home’s condition matches the price you’ve set on it.

This comes into play for almost every listing. As your listing agent, we do provide a staging consultation where our stager will give you a list of items that would help along the way. The more you fulfill from this list, the closer we can get to your target list price.

Avoiding these three mistakes is a part of the core to being successful in your sale.
