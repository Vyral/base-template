*Even if you’re not looking for a home in our market, we can connect you with someone who can help out. Here’s how.*

Today’s question comes from Linda, who wants to know, “Dave, can you help with out-of-area properties?” Wendy asked us a similar question recently, too.

The answer is yes, we can help. Keller Williams Realty International allows us to have access all over the world. **No matter if you’re looking to buy or sell a home in Boise, Idaho, or Frankfurt, Germany, we can pinpoint the area you’re looking in and find the top agents in those markets.** Whether it’s a residential or commercial property, we can use this strategy to help you out.

People want three things in a Realtor: Someone they can trust, someone that cares about them, and someone that can get the job done. We can quickly screen the agents in a certain area that will check all three boxes.&nbsp;

**This service doesn’t cost you anything.** We’re simply glad to connect you to someone who can care for you if you’re in need.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
