Now that we’ve finally reached the fall, you may be wondering if it’s too late to sell your home. **If you’re worried your home won’t sell for some reason, I’m here to tell you that it will.** There’s an old saying: “There’s a lid for every pot,” and these days, there are multiple lids for every pot; the lids are buyers and the pots are sellers. With the right price, marketing, location, and excellent photos, you’d be surprised by how quickly a home can sell.&nbsp;

This summer, homes were selling for 10% to 40% over market value. Appraisal approval is still required, but in many cases, appraisers are giving a little more value to homes, so we’re seeing higher prices. That’s both a good and bad thing because prices throughout the Louisville and Southern Indiana areas are going to increase faster than we’ve seen in past years, but since there’s such demand and a lack of supply, that’s the only thing that can happen.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling your home, you want to stage it and declutter—less is more when selling your house. If you’re thinking about selling, we’re more than glad to come out and discuss what does or doesn’t need to be done before going on the market.&nbsp;

Nowadays, **homes sell all year round**, so if you’ve been waiting to list your home but think you may have missed the boat, there are plenty of buyers who were disappointed this summer because they made offers but they weren’t accepted. Then sometimes buyers climb back on the fence to wait for the market to improve. However, we’ve gone from an average of about 1,300 homes on the market per day to more than 1,700, so buyers are jumping back into the fray. Next year, we’re likely to see mortgage rates rise, which will reduce buyers’ purchasing power, so they’ll want to get into a property before rates climb.&nbsp;

**We can sell your home now, next month, or even next year quickly and for the most money**. If you want more information about what we do and how we do it or have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call anytime day or night. I would love to be your real estate resource.&nbsp;
