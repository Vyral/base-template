A common question clients ask me is: Where do we get our list to call? There are actually two options I want to talk about.

There are actually two options I want to talk about. Most people are familiar with purchasing access to expired, canceled, or withdrawn listings. But there’s also a way you can purchase premium lists to get better results.

That being said, you are going to pay a premium rate for those lists. Depending on the type of list and the amount you’re purchasing, **these can run anywhere from seven cents to 30 cents per record.**

Premium lists will help you weed through to find people who are the most likely to sell their home in the next 12 months.

If you give us access to your expired service, we’ll pull from that list every two weeks. That way, your virtual assistant can give them a call.

However, we don’t want to contact any brand-new expired listings. Those homeowners are getting anywhere from 60 to 70 phone calls a day in some markets. We don’t want to compete with that.

We want to pick up calling where other agents have stopped. After that point we’re persistent, but aren’t going to be calling the same neighborhood multiple times per day or week.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
