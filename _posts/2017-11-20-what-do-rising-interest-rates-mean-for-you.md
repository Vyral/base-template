Interest rates have begun to rise in our market, and they’re expected to rise between 0.25% and 0.75% per year moving forward. What does this mean for buyers and sellers?

For a $400,000 house, you can expect to pay about $50 per month more for every 0.25% rise in interest rates. Right now, at 4% interest, you’d pay about $46 per month more for that house.

The current monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage is about $1,375. For a $400,000 mortgage, it’s roughly $1,835. That doesn’t include insurance or taxes, though, so make sure to add those things if you want a more accurate estimate.

What does all this mean? **Whether you’re buying or selling, right now is a great time to position your next mortgage payment.** As interest rates rise, that will affect your payment for the next several years, so you want to take advantage of rates as they are now. Even though they were lower in the past, they’re still historically low right now.
