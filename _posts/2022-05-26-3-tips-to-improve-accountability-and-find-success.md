Successful people are accountable people. Accountability is defined as an obligation or willingness to accept responsibility or account for one’s actions. So, are you accountable? Whether we’re talking about your personal life or your business, accountability is the difference between success and failure. Here are three tips to be accountable and implement accountability into your world:

1. **Accountability starts with you.** That’s right; you have to be accountable to your own standards in your role. Roles need to be defined, and the tasks associated with them need to be written out. If you’re a real estate agent, you can use the models from “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” by Gary Keller. Use it as a guide to start your business; you don’t have to start from scratch.&nbsp;

You must also show up and perform the way you would like your team to. This, in turn, will help you attract accountable people. By the way, as a leader, you have to own everything in your business, including the failures and successes.&nbsp;

1. **Apply accountability to all equally.** No one gets special deals or a pass; everyone should know what’s expected of them. Also, make sure your standards are realistic based on the skills, education, and training of your team members. Everyone should know the standards and be monitored accordingly at least once a week.&nbsp;

1. **Accountability has many forms.** For example, as a leader, you hold your team members accountable. However, successful people like to be held accountable, so you need someone to keep you accountable as a leader. For me, my best form of accountability is when I pay someone to hold me accountable because I view it as an investment in myself. When accountability has worked for me, I really respected and even kind of feared my coach. This way, I know I need to show up for them because I know they care about me both personally and professionally. They are there to help me achieve my goals, not ones they picked out for me.&nbsp;

As soon as I implemented being accountable, open, and coachable into my life, everything changed. Show up and be accountable, and you will see a difference in your life. Call or email me, and let me know how you handle accountability in your own life; I look forward to hearing from you\!
