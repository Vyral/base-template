<center>You may be familiar with how to tap into your home&rsquo;s equity by refinancing your FHA, VA, or conventional, but do you know about HELOCs?</center>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Today I’m giving you a tip on how to tap into your home’s equity by using a home equity line of credit, or HELOC.&nbsp;

With a HELOC, the line of credit your lender offers can be utilized up to a certain maximum amount, but **the beauty of this product is that you only pay for what you use.**&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

For example, let’s say you have a line of credit for $100,000 secured by your home, but you need to fix up your kitchen and that costs $20,000. Even though your line of credit is much higher than the kitchen repair costs, you’re making interest-only payments on just that $20,000.&nbsp;

So, again, when you utilize your HELOC, you pay on the balance only, not the whole line of credit. When you do use the whole line, that’s called a second mortgage, something I will explain more in my next video message.&nbsp;

Until then, if you have any mortgage-related questions or needs, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email. I’m here to help.&nbsp;
