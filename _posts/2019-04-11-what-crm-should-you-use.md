Agents often ask me what CRM they should use in their real estate business, and so I’d like to share my response to this common question today. So what is the best CRM? It’s simple: The best CRM is the one you can learn and use each day. The quality of a CRM won’t mean anything if you aren’t willing to put in the effort to make it work for you. The consumer-facing side of the site is actually much less important than backend systems you’ll be utilizing each day. If you have any other questions about CRMs and how to use them, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
