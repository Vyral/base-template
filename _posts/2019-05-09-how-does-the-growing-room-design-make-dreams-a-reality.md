I was recently joined by my friend Noa Artzi-Weill, founder and creator of The Growing Room Design, and I was very excited that she let me feature her and her business and one of her most recent projects. With a background in design and marketing, Noa uses her skill at The Growing Room Design to create beautiful, custom spaces for her clients. **Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

0:45- Noa explains how she found her niche (and her passion) in interior design

1:35- Noa goes through her thought process in creating that beautiful graffiti design

2:30- How Noah created the graffiti mural and how she bridges the age and gender gap when designing spaces

3:45- Noa explains how she chooses the flooring that she installs

4:30- Exploring the design of the larger area of the basement

5:50- Does every basement Noa creates match the intensity of this one?

6:55- How Noa uses unique architecture to her advantage when designing spaces

7:40- How long do Noa’s projects usually take?

Thanks so much to Noa for joining me for this fascinating discussion. **If you have any quesitons for her or want to learn more about what she does, give her a call at (646) 644-0204 or visit her online at**[**www.thegrowingroomdesign.com**](http://www.thegrowingroomdesign.com)\*\*. \*\*
