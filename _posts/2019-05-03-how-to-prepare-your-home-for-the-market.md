People always ask us what steps they must take to prepare their home for the market.&nbsp;

Well, in addition to having us perform an analysis of the property, the first step any future seller must take is to clean and declutter. If you’re not using something, it’s time to pack it away.&nbsp;

**The key to preparing a home is to make sure that it looks fresh and inviting, and that all its major systems, appliances, and features are in working order.** If a lightbulb is burnt out, for example, you need to change it before buyers set foot inside.&nbsp;

You should also take the time to paint both inside and out. This will make your property seem like its brand new.&nbsp;

If you follow these steps and work closely with our team to make any other preparations your specific property may need, you’ll be sure to capture and keep an interested buyer’s attention in no time.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
