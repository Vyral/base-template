<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Laura Siegemund is not only an accomplished tennis pro, but she’s also our house guest for the week. I sat down with her before her big match and we had a great conversation.</em></p>

I’m so excited to be joined by a very special guest today. **Laura Siegemund Is a professional tennis player and stays with our family every time she’s in town for the Annual WTA Volvo Car Open, which is actually the largest women’s-only tennis tournament in North America.** This year, we’re so excited to watch her, so I just wanted to ask her a few questions:

***How long have you been playing tennis?***

“I’ve been playing a very long time. I started when I was three years old, playing with my dad in the street at home in Germany. I got my first lessons when I was four.”

***What’s your best memory from playing tennis?***

“There are a lot of different memories. I wouldn’t say there’s one specific one. Personally, it was a highlight to play at the Olympic Games in 2016. My first WTA title in Sweden in 2016, my win at home in Stuttgart, and when I beat Venus Williams here at the Volvo Car Open. They’re all really special to me.”

***What do you like about being in Charleston?***

“I’ve traveled the world and what I love about Charleston is that it’s familiar. The same people are here every year, and we love staying with you… In some places you have to travel an hour across a city to get to a tournament, but here all we need is a golf cart.”&nbsp;

Thanks so much for Laura joining me. **We are so excited to cheer for our favorite German tennis player this year and for many years to come.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
