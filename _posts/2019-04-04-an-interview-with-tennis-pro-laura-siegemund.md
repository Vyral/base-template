I sat down with her before her big match and we had a great conversation.</p><p>I&rsquo;m so excited to be joined by a very special guest today. <strong>Laura Siegemund Is a professional tennis player and stays with our family every time she&rsquo;s in town for the 47th annual WTA Volvo Car Open, which is actually the largest women&rsquo;s-only tennis tournament in North America.</strong> This year, we&rsquo;re so excited to watch her, so I just wanted to ask her a few questions:</p><p><em><strong>How long have you been playing tennis?</strong></em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been playing a very long time. I started when I was three years old, playing with my dad in the street at home in Germany. I got my first lessons when I was four.&rdquo;</p><p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s your best memory from playing tennis?</strong></em></p><p>&ldquo;There are a lot of different memories. I wouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s one specific one. Personally, it was a highlight to play at the Olympic Games in 2016. My first WTA title in Sweden in 2016, my win at home in Stuttgart, and when I beat Venus Williams here at the Volvo Car Open. They&rsquo;re all really special to me.&rdquo;</p><p>{% include pullquote.html %}

***What do you like about being in Charleston?***

“I’ve traveled the world and what I love about Charleston is that it’s familiar. The same people are here every year, and we love staying with you... In some places you have to travel an hour across a city to get to a tournament, but here all we need is a golf cart.”&nbsp;

Thanks so much for Laura joining me. **We are so excited to cheer for our favorite German tennis player this year and for many years to come.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
