It’s a beautiful May afternoon and as I was out showing some homes, I had about 20 minutes to kill so I decided to walk around the beautiful McKenzie Reservoir in Wallingford with a message for today’s homebuyers.

**I know you’re frustrated.** I know you’re getting less house for your money and losing out on multiple offer situations time after time. We’re working with some buyers who still haven't found luck after the seventh or eighth try and making very competitive offers.

In this type of market, reference points and experience matter when choosing an agent. **If you’re looking for something specific, you should be working with an experienced agent who knows about local inventory before it hits the market.** I’m currently aware of three different homes that are coming on the market in the next two and a half weeks.&nbsp;

More times than not, we’re able to give our clients a heads up on homes before they’re officially listed on the MLS. **We’re well-equipped to help you navigate this competitive home-buying market.** That’s a guarantee.

If you have any questions about buying a home, the market, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
