After an offer has been accepted, what comes next? Today let’s talk about what the due diligence period in a real estate transaction looks like for buyers and sellers.

My team and I obviously have a lot of experience with this subject and have seen both ends of a real estate deal several times over; but for now, I’d like to focus mainly on the buyers’ side of things.

When a seller accepts a buyer’s offer, the stage in the transaction that follows is called the due diligence period. First of all, **many aspects of the process will vary depending on the particular property.** For example, the length of the inspection period will depend on the size of the asset.

But before the inspection is ordered, buyers usually join me or one of my team members for an initial walkthrough. It’s often on this same day that the home inspection is performed.

Also, if you plan on working with a property manager or property management company to handle the asset, I highly recommend that they’re present when you visit the property so that they can check out each unit.

My team and I also work with a number of professional contractors we’d be happy to connect you with, **whether you need a roofer, a plumber, or any other specialized work or opinions on the property.**

If there is something that needs to be addressed, the seller will be contacted, and we will proceed with whatever necessary to make sure you, the buyer, feel comfortable.

At this point, assuming everything else is in order, we can finally proceed to closing. My team and I are very hands-on when we work with our clients. We believe that communication is key.
