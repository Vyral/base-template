<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Millennials have come up with an ingenious solution to solving their financial woes: crowdfunding. Here’s how that can apply to your next home purchase.</em></p>

**The new generation coming into the market is taking up a large portion of the homebuying demographics.** Millennials as a generation are very interested in obtaining their college degrees. They can choose to go the traditional route and waiting to pay down all their debts before thinking of buying a home, or, if they have a good job and income, the only barrier they have is saving for the down payment. Saving for the down payment will take resources away from paying down their debts.

I love millennials; they don’t work hard—they work smart. They had a problem and then found a way to solve it: crowdfunding\! This means they’re going to their friends, family, and generous strangers to ask for money to assist with their down payment.

**So if you’re a millennial, you should know that right now is a perfect time to buy a house.** And with the holidays coming, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask those you know and love help with your down payment in the form of gift money.

If you’re interested in buying a home, reach out to me. We can set up a crowdfunding plan for you so that you can purchase your first home. I hope to hear from you soon\!
