As a home seller, how do you know which offer to pick in a multiple offer situation?

**Want to sell your Central Iowa home?** <a href="http://www.centraliahomevalues.com/" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a>
**Want to buy a Central Iowa home?** <a href="http://mistysold.searchcentraliowahomes.com/" target="_blank">Search all the homes on the MLS</a>

If you're moving, these three tips should help you out quite a bit:

**1. Don't pick a peak day to move:** In the central Iowa market, Fridays and Saturdays are the peak days, as well as the 1st, 30th, and 31st of each month.

**2. Pack smart:** You can read about some great moving hacks here. They'll help you plan, organize, and execute the process of getting all your belongings together efficiently. On top of these hacks, you should try to take the emotion out of packing. It's hard to avoid taking a trip down memory lane when you pack your stuff, but try to save it for when you're in your new place.
