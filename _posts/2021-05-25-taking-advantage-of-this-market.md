What do buyers and sellers need to know about our hyper-competitive seller’s market?

**If you’re a seller, don’t wait for competition to pop up in your neighborhood.** As long as there’s still an influx of buyers with few homes to choose from, you have an opportunity to maximize your financial goals and eliminate any additional days your home will sit on the market.&nbsp;

**If you’re a buyer, stay disciplined.** When the market starts to balance out, make sure your pre-approval is up to date and your credit score hasn’t taken any unexpected hits. Also, to the best of your ability, don’t touch any funds that have been set aside for closing costs or out-of-pocket expenses such as inspection and/or appraisal fees.

If you’d like more information on how to successfully buy or sell in this market, be sure to give the Air Assault Team a call or visit our website. Homeowners: Make sure you take advantage of our free home evaluation tool and find out how much your home is worth in no time at all. We look forward to hearing from you soon\!
