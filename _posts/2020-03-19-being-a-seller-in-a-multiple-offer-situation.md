<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what you must remember when choosing between multiple offers.</em></p>

As a seller, what’s the best way to choose between multiple offers on your home? There are a couple tips to keep in mind.

First, **make sure your offers are organized.** For example, you can try having your offers on a spreadsheet so you can easily identify which has the most earnest money, which has the highest price overall, etc.&nbsp;

Second, **make sure your Realtor “plays detective” with each buyer.** They should be talking to each of their agents and asking questions about them. They should also talk to each buyer’s lender and learn more about their financial situation. This will give you a better idea of how strong each buyer is, and your Realtor should know which questions to ask without crossing the line.&nbsp;

After gathering this information, you and your Realtor should be able to choose the best offer. Don’t get fixated on an offer that’s way above your asking price, either. Offers like these sometimes cause your house to not appraise.&nbsp;

When it comes to choosing between multiple offers, the bottom line is that you must lean on your Realtor to help you decide.&nbsp;
