*Here’s how home offices are helping sellers get an edge on the market.*

When the real estate market reignited in the summer of 2020 and the nation’s workforce transitioned into a work-from-home force, properties with office spaces became highly coveted. Gone are the days of buyers wanting a completely open main floor where everyone can see and hear everyone else. (Most of us found out pretty quickly that a schedule full of Zoom meetings doesn’t mix well with energetic toddlers or curious pets). When it’s time to get work done, we need a few walls. Home offices are a must in today’s home search, and homebuilders are taking note.&nbsp;

**We’re now seeing homebuilders put together home office packages** as an available upgrade for buyers, and those will surely make a big splash when they hit the market. Many potential sellers are getting creative and testing whether any existing rooms in their home can be converted into a home office. Though, if you’re going to put your home on the market soon, it’s probably best to simply stage a room as an office rather than invest in hardware or time-consuming renovations. There are smart ways you can show off a room's capabilities as an office or study space without having to tie up your money and hope for a return.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller who doesn’t have any extra bedrooms, consider marketing a small storage room as an office. One investment that might be worthwhile in that case would be a glass door instead of a solid one; the more light coming into the office, the better. If you already installed a home office years ago and were thankful for it throughout 2020, know that buyers will be thankful for it, too. **If you were to list soon, your home would absolutely have an edge against others on the market.&nbsp;**
