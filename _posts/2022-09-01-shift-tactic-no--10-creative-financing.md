As you know by now, the market is shifting, but it’s not all doom and gloom for real estate professionals. When you use the tactics we’ve been covering over the past few weeks, you’ll give yourself an advantage over your peers by winning with both your buyers and sellers. In today’s installment of my “Shift” series, I’ll discuss **some creative strategies home sellers can employ to help them sell their properties.**

As a real estate professional, you can help your sellers sweeten the deal for prospective buyers by:

**&nbsp; 1. Offering seller contributions** to buyers in the form of a credit at the closing.

**&nbsp; 2. Offering seller-funded buydowns**, both temporary and permanent. This is a popular tactic in today’s market, where interest rates are rising.

**&nbsp; 3. Using owner financing** to eliminate the need for a lending intermediary. This isn’t a common tactic, but it’s available under the right circumstances.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

**&nbsp; 4. Utilizing assumable loans**, which are loans that allow the buyer to take on your seller’s loan and interest rate. Remember that the buyer will need to come to the closing table with the difference between the home’s appraised value and what is owed on the property.
