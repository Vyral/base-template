Here are a few spring cleaning tips you might not know about yet.

It’s that time of year for a little spring cleaning. Here are three great tips to help freshen up your home:

**1\. Clean your ceiling fans with pillowcases.** One of the hardest spots to clean also happens to collect the most dust. Fit an old pillowcase around the blades and use it as a dustrag.

**2\. Clean your mattress.** Did you know we spend around 3,000 hours per year in our beds? Remove all bedding, vacuum the surface, and sprinkle a few drops of your favorite essential oil along with baking soda. This will help clean the mattress, remove moisture, and make it smell fresh.

**3\. Deep clean your fridge.** Pull out everything from your fridge. Take the shelves and bins out and wash with warm, soapy water. Then wipe down surfaces that can’t be removed before putting the shelves back.

These are just a few things you can do to get your home ready for the spring. If you have any other questions about preparing for spring or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
