For part two of our 6 Personal perspectives, we’ll talk through the 80/20 rule. Last time, we went through self-mastery. If you missed it, you can access it [here](/six-personal-perspectives-part-1-self-mastery.html).

This principle was developed by Vilfredo Pareto back in the 1800s. **What it states is that 20% of our efforts will lead to 80% of the outcome.** Pareto saw this in crop growth with 20% of growers making up 80% of crop yield in the area. If you look this up, you’ll see it happening in lots of different industries.&nbsp;

We can use this by remembering that 20% of what we do, as long as we do the right things, will lead to 80% of the outcome. **What actions make up these 20% in real estate?** Lead generation, lead follow-up, writing contracts, negotiating contracts, and going on appointments are all probably part of this.&nbsp;

**When agents focus on that 20%, over time that leads to 80% of their income.** Find out this week what you’re currently doing and develop those key items, the 20%, that can help you improve. You could even reverse engineer this and think about what goal you want to reach and what tasks will help you get there.&nbsp;

Next time we’ll be back with our third part, going from entrepreneurial to purposeful. If you have any questions about this topic in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’re always here to help.
