*Just how accurate is Zillow’s Zestimate feature? Today, I’ve got some information you need to know before relying on this website.*

Many people are curious about the true credibility of Zillow’s Zestimate feature.

First, the Zestimate relies only on data because it is computer-generated. Nothing else can be taken into account. This becomes even more of an issue because Montana is a non-disclosure state, meaning that **real estate transactions are not public information and cannot be pulled up through databases.**

The Zestimate also has the disadvantage of there being no personal viewing of the property. The Zestimate is based strictly off of numbers.

It also isn’t bankable. You can’t walk into a bank or lender with a Zestimate and expect it to count as an appraisal. In order to move forward, you will need a real appraisal.

A major reason for this is that Zestimates can be very inaccurate. **The CEO of Zillow himself sold his home for $750,000 below his Zestimate, which was almost 50% of the sales price.**

You can see for yourself how reliable Zillow is based on some of the information included [**[here](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/#acc)****.**]
