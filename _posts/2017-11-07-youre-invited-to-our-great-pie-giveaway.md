I want to say thank you so much for the wonderful year that we’ve had. We couldn’t have done it without you.

As a token of our gratitude, we’re once again holding our **Great Pie Giveaway**. We’ve given away hundreds of pies each year for the last three years, with this year being our fourth giveaway.

You should have received a postcard in the mail, so if you do want a pie, we’d like to encourage you to **RSVP for yours by Thursday, November 16th,** by emailing me or calling the number provided. We want to serve you and your family over the holidays the way that you’ve helped us over the year.

We’re going to order enough pies for everybody who wants one for their family. You can pick up your pie at our office in Mt. Pleasant on\*\* Monday, November 20th, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., or Tuesday, November 21st, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.\*\*

Again, thank you so much for supporting us and our business. If there’s anything we can do for you, just let us know.
