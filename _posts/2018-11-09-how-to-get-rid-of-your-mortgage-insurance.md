If you bought a home and put down less than 20% on that home, you’re familiar with mortgage insurance—its the amount on your monthly statement that you wish you could get rid of.

Well, I have good news for you today: **You may be able to get rid of it, after all.**

Homes with less than 20% equity are more risky for lenders today, so they require you to provide mortgage insurance for them.

If you were to go out today and get a conventional mortgage on your property that’s less than 20% and above 5%, they would require what’s called private mortgage insurance. FHA loans, on the other hand, require regular mortgage insurance.

Mortgage insurance simply gives a bit of comfort to the lender; if you were to foreclose on the property, for example, they would get paid back in full through the mortgage insurance company.

**So** **how do you get rid of mortgage insurance?**

You can request an appraisal from your mortgage insurance company. Once you have at least 20% equity on the property, you can also request that your lender drop that mortgage insurance altogether.

There is one caveat: **If you got an FHA loan after June 3, 2013, you can no longer request to drop your mortgage insurance.** FHA loans approved before that date can still make that request.

A lot of people with FHA loans are refinancing for conventional loans. People nowadays are in a much stronger position with their home equity than they think; they might not know it, but they could have the ability to drop their mortgage insurance right now.

If you’re wondering about your own equity position and whether or not you’re able to drop your mortgage insurance, reach out to me. I’m offering a free mortgage insurance review to see if you are able to request having your mortgage insurance dropped. Hope to hear from you soon!
