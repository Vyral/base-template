Today we’ll be talking with our own Kristen Mathosian about the lending process. Before joining our team as a real estate agent, she actually worked as a lender for almost 20 years, so she has plenty of great insight to share with us.

**For a mortgage, you can choose the services of a big bank, an online lender, or a local lender.** Big banks offer a lot of services, which means they’re not solely focused on mortgages. A local lender, however, only focuses on mortgage loans. This gives them more expertise, and they want you to be successful as their client.

**Kristen selects her lenders based off a few criteria.** Communication is key; clients need to feel secure with the person they’re working with. In addition, a good timeline and honesty are also invaluable in a lender. Lenders should also be able to explain the tricky parts of the transaction in a way that’s easily understood.

If you have any questions about lending or have any real estate needs, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
