Many people think spring and summer are the best times to sell your homeâ€”after all, the flowers are in bloom and your home looks great. However, winter is a great time to sell your home, and today I wanted to give you the top three reasons why:

1. **Serious buyers****.** These are buyers who have seen your home online and they're ready to put on their coats and snow boots to come see it. You won't get the looky-loos and the tire-kickers. Buyers out braving the winter weather are pre-approved and ready to write an offer.
2. **Less competition.**Since so many people wait for spring or summer to sell their home, you won't have to compete against nearly as many sellers in the winter. Most sellers wait because their kids are in school or they just think their home will sell better in the spring. Not only is there less competition, inventory is lower, so you're more likely to see an offer on your home immediately.
3. **Low interest rates.** if you're selling your house, odds are you'll need to buy a new one. The good thing is that interest rates are still very low and there's still time to take advantage and lock them in.

Those are the top three reasons, but it doesn't stop there. As real estate agents, we depend on vendors like home inspectors, appraisers, and loan officers to close a transaction, and during the wintertime, things are slower for them as well. In the winter, we're able to get their full attention, and it's easier to get on their schedule.
