There’s no question that this year is different than the rest. Spring is already here. Tulips are already blooming and so is the market.

**Interest rates are beginning to creep up, and this trend will likely continue through the spring and summer.**In other words, now is the right time to get on the market, whether you are a buyer or a seller.

Homes that couldn't sell last year are selling now. I just listed a home that sat on the market all year in 2017 and was able to sell it in a matter of just three weeks.

If you’re considering buying a home this year, watch rates very carefully. If rates rise from their current 4.25% to, say, 5.25%, the increase in cost could run high.

Ultimately, now is the right time to take advantage of the market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
