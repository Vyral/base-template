A lot of people were hit hard by the real estate market crash last decade. Now, those same people can reap the rewards of the market’s recovery.

Just a few years ago here in Tyler, we hit a pretty severe downturn in the housing market (and the economy as a whole). As a result, there were a lot of people from 2009-2012 who owed more on their homes than they were worth. That’s changed a lot in the last few years, however, as we’ve seen a dramatic increase in pricing. **This is especially true for homes in the $250,000 and below range.**

When we spoke to homeowners during the market downturn, we had to start putting Kleenex out because so many of them ended up shedding tears over the loss of value in their home because of the crash.

We might have to start putting Kleenex out for those same people, though, because if they come in today and find out what their home is worth in this market, **they’re likely to cry tears of joy.**

A recent study showed that 60% of Americans have dramatic equity in their home of at least 20%. **Texas has been one of the leading states in the recovery,** with home values increasing by 8% on average in the past year alone.

If you’re considering selling your home, we currently have a shortage of inventory that you could take advantage of to sell for top dollar. If you have any questions for us or you want us to do a complimentary analysis of the equity you have in your home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
