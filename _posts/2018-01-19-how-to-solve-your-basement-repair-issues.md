Today I’m joined by Chris and Roger with Accurate Basement Repair to talk a little bit about a basement excavation project they are doing and how they’re making sure things are done the right way.

According to Roger, when a basement wall has cracked, failed, and moved too far, it can’t really be braced. It has to be straightened and braced instead. **If a wall has moved more than one inch off of the foundation, excavation repairs are going to be necessary**.
