Here are my top three tips to get your offer accepted in a seller’s market.

As we’ve mentioned in our last several videos, we’re currently in an extreme, red-hot seller’s market. There’s a lot of competition amongst buyers because our inventory is very low. If you’re in the market to buy a home, what can you do to get your offer more attention and stand out from your competition? I have three tips to help you:

**1\. Follow the instructions on the MLS.** This seems simple enough, but I can’t tell you how many times agents fail to follow those instructions. When your buyer’s agent doesn’t follow the instructions, your offer’s appeal will drop because the listing agent may not feel comfortable working with them for a long period given that they couldn’t follow those instructions. Have a conversation with your agent, and if they’re not good at listening to your needs, it might be time to reevaluate your decision to work with them.

**2\. Find out the seller’s needs.** Many buyers write offers with short close-of-escrow periods, or offer them cash because they think that’s what’s attractive to the seller. Sometimes that might be the case, but it could be that the seller needs a 60-day escrow or a 30-day rentback. Be sure to find out what it is the seller is looking for in an offer rather than just assuming what they want.

**3\. Write a letter to the seller.** Be sure to be detailed—let them know who you are and why their house is attractive to you. Now, if you *really* want to stand out, send the seller a video. We help our clients film seller videos with them standing in front of the property they’re looking to buy. By doing one of these things, the seller may begin to look at you as a person with a family instead of just one of their prospective buyers.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like more tips on boosting your offer in an extreme seller’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
