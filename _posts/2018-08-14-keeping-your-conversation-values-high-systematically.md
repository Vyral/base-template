Today is part four of the real estate fundamentals series. This really is a sequential process where you need to stack these pieces up to build up to the more advanced topics later. &nbsp;Previously I spoke about the significance of clarity of goals, the importance of time blocking, and finally I debunked the myths about lead generation.
