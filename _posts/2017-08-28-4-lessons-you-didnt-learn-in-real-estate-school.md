We all know that there’s an extremely low barrier of entry into the real estate business. In real estate school, you’re taught little more than how to not get in trouble with the law. You won’t learn how to become an effective salesperson at real estate school, which is what you need to do if you want to succeed in this business. Here are four lessons that you won’t learn in real estate school that you need to learn in order to have a successful career:

1.&nbsp;**Don’t choose a brokerage based on their fee structure**. There’s no such thing as keeping 100% commission—you don’t have to learn the hard way. Of course you’re focused on the money you’re going to make, but too many agents make this their only criteria when choosing a brokerage. They haven’t figured out that whenever you’re giving up commission, you’re getting value somewhere else. As a new agent, you want a brokerage with training, education, and mentoring as opposed to one who “claims” to let you keep 100% of your commission. We’ve never kept 100% commission in any transaction throughout our careers.

2.&nbsp;**How to generate business**. Real estate school won’t teach you how to generate business as a new agent. A lot of new agents end up focusing their energy in the wrong areas. We see a lot of passive lead generation techniques like flyers and social media posts. Although these things have value, they have to be used in a combination with good old-fashioned lead generation. Before you can be a great agent, you need to learn how to become a great salesperson.

3.&nbsp;**You have to learn how to deal with rejection**. This is a tough concept for most people to grasp. However, when you realize in our business that one yes trumps hundreds of no’s, rejection won’t bother you much. Conversely, it will motivate you to try that much harder to get the next person to say yes.

4.&nbsp;**Don’t overlook culture and environment when choosing a brokerage**. It’s essential to put yourself in an environment that fosters growth, provides education, and surrounds you with people who are going to inspire you to reach your goals.
