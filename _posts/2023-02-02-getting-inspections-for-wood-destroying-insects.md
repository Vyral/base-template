We deal with Miller Pest & Termite for all our listing transactions because we need a wood-destroying insect report as part of a real estate transaction.

The wood-destroying inspection pest professional will come out to take a look and complete what's called an MPMA 33 federally-regulated form. If you use any lender, you must complete a DEA inspection or wood-destroying insect report.&nbsp;

They’ll inspect the entire interior and exterior of the property, including any detached buildings. The aim is to identify whether or not there are any issues with termites, carpenter ants, or any other wood-boring beetles that can degrade the integrity of the structures on the property. **Everyone wants to ensure that the property being sold is safe.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions about this form of the inspection process, don’t hesitate to contact us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
