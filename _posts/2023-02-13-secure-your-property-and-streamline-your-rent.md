As a property owner, you want to ensure that your space is well taken care of and that you're receiving the rent money you're owedâ€”that's why you need a property management company. These are two things we guarantee to do for you:&nbsp;

**1\. Protect your property.** We will conduct walk-throughs, background checks, and credit checks to ensure that your property is safe and secure. Those things are crucial to protect your rental income and keep your property in good condition.&nbsp;

**2\. Maintain your property.** We will be responsible for maintaining your property and ensuring that it stays in good shape. This could include 15 to 20 tasks a year, such as cleaning and repairs. By doing this, we will keep your property in good condition and increase its value over time.&nbsp;
