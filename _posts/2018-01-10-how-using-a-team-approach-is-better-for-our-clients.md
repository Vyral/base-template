Why do we use the team approach in real estate?

**When I first got started in real estate, I was handling several different aspects of the profession.** I was attending closings, managing paperwork, and more.

As I became more and more busy, I found that it became increasingly difficult to manage every task at the highest level. At that point, I knew I needed to start utilizing a team approach to real estate.

**At the Dauby Team, providing quality customer service is our top priority.**Dividing the work across a team allows us to devote a higher level of focus to individual needs.

Beyond simply providing quality service, we also care deeply about communication. We strive to provide you with our feedback within 24 hours.

On our team we have buyer’s agents, seller’s agents, and other specialized professionals all working together to provide you with the best service possible.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
