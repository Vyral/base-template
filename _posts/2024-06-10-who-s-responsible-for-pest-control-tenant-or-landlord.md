Who’s responsible for pest control: The tenant or the owner? **Here’s how we handle this question.**

Before a tenant moves into a property we manage, we fill out a property condition form to make sure there are no issues. However, if the tenant finds roaches, termites, or other pests within 30 days of moving in, dealing with them is an owner’s expense. After 30 days, we can safely assume that the pests were brought in by the tenant, so it becomes a tenant’s responsibility to handle them.

This system gives you clear guidelines that avoid drawn-out disputes. If you have questions about this topic or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to help!
