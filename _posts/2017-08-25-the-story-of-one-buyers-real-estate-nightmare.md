Today, I’ve got a story to tell you about a buyer who lost their dream home all because they decided to sleep on the decision instead of making a move.

A while back I had a listing on a market. In today’s market, things are moving quickly—listings often receive multiple offers within a week. In the case of this listing, specifically, a buyer came along after just a couple of days and gave an offer that was under the asking price.

Since the seller was already receiving a lot of activity and competing offers, they felt confident shooting back a counteroffer that was a little higher than the one the buyer originally gave.

When the buyer got this counteroffer, they decided to take a while to sleep on it. However, **this ended up costing them the home**.

Because this particular buyer didn’t get back to us in time, another offer came along that was, in fact, over asking price.

Obviously, the seller accepted this offer right away. Because of this, sleeping on their dream home quickly turned into a nightmare for the buyer who lost out instead of making their move right away.

To avoid this happening to you, you’ll need the help of an expert. Letting a professional guide you and advise you against sleeping on things will make a lot of difference. **Sometimes an expert’s job is to tell you the things you need to hear, not just the things you want to**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
