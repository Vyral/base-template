Agents looking to take your business to the next level: I’m really excited to share a tool that we at the Salas Team use to help our agents track their success.

Oftentimes in our business, we look at metrics like how many units we sell, sales volume, and GCI. The issue with these metrics is that they are lagging indicators. If you realize that you are not meeting the goals that you set for yourself, it is already too late to correct the activity. Instead, let’s move that process to the fore and think about what we need to do on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis in order to meet the goals.

The tool that the Salas Team uses is our **weekly activity log tracker, which allows us to track key numbers to make sure that we’re engaged in the proper activities.** To see what that looks like, refer to 1:20 in the video above.

At the top of the sheet, you’ll see the section labeled “Dials.” The number of dials you log are factors that you as an agent can control. These dials can be how many calls you make, door-knocking, networking with people at events, and similar. You need to have those conversations because dials are huge lead indicators. With Mojo and other automatic dialers like it, we can get up to 300 dials a day; however, depending on your goals and circumstances, you may not need to get that high.

Next, you need to maintain your contacts properly. **Contacts** are two-way conversations; don’t fool yourself into thinking that calls and emails which don’t get responses are indicators of good activity. You need to be sure that you’re having an actual conversation with your leads. Even if you call someone to discuss their expired listing and they hang up on you, that’s a contact. Track that activity. **This is especially critical for newer agents, who need to have somewhere between 80 and 100 contacts per week in order to set one appointment.** More seasoned agents can afford to have only 20 to 60 contacts a week in order to get an appointment.

Another part of the weekly log tracker is called **“Set, Met, and Signed.”** ‘Set’ refers to how many appointments you set on a weekly basis; ‘met’ is how many of those appointments actually came through; and ‘signed’ refers to how many of those appointments ended in a client signing a listing or a buyer agency contract. In my experience, those who want to make $100,000 or more in this business have to track at a 4-3-2 SMS rate: they’ll need to set at least four appointments a week, meet with at least three of those, and sign with two of them. If you follow that rhythm over a 48-week period, you can’t help but be successful.

The final part of the log tracker I’ll address is at the very bottom: Write down the names of your appointments and lead sources. The latter is critical—**you need to know where your leads are coming from,** whether it’s from an open house, an expired listing, a For Sale By Owner (FSBO) listing, your sphere of influence, or a referral. Focus your efforts on which ones are producing leads for you.

If you’d like a hard copy of our weekly activity log tracker or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to send you a copy so that you can better track and guide your habits toward success.
