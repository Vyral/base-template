<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our spring market has already arrived, despite the fact that winter isn’t yet behind us. If you’re curious what this means for you, check out today’s message.</em></p>

Though spring is yet to arrive, our spring market is already in full effect.&nbsp;

With that said, there are a few stand-out developments buyers and sellers should keep in mind moving forward.&nbsp;

**1,199 homes have sold in the last six months, which, historically, indicates a very strong market.&nbsp;**

Another interesting development is the year-over-year decline in inventory. At this time last year, there were about 700 homes on the market. Right now, there are just 571 listings available. It’s clear to see that inventory is tight.

**New listings are still coming in at a similar rate as last year, but increased demand means that these homes are selling fairly quickly.&nbsp;**

As a final note, buyers will be excited to know that interest rates have dropped once again. This is a temporary development, but one that makes now an ideal time to make a move.&nbsp;

Buyers and sellers alike have a lot of opportunities before them, so don’t delay in making your real estate goals a reality.&nbsp;
