Credit protection is an incredibly important subject to those of who use credit in our daily lives. **Recently, the Equifax data breach impacted 145 million people’s credit.**

Good credit is extremely valuable these days. As an owner and a business manager in the rental management business, I can tell you that we always check credit.

We won’t accept people with a credit score below 620, which just goes to show how important your credit score is.

Personally, I recommend that you research the Equifax credit breach. Do so as soon as possible. Being unaware of your circumstances would be a huge mistake. With approximately 350 million people living in America, a massive portion of the population has been affected.

**Having protection like LifeLock could make a big difference in the security of your credit.** Don’t wait until it’s too late. Correcting your credit score can take between 60 to 90 days.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
