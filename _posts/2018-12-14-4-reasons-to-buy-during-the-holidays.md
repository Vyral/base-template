There are four reasons why the holidays are the perfect time to buy a home.

First, **you’ll face less competition from other buyers.** Most buyers take December off to celebrate the holidays, host out-of-town guests, attend family gatherings, etc. And quite frankly, stomping through the snow in the middle of winter to look at houses isn’t that much fun. A lot of buyers have also heard that right now is a lousy time to buy a house. Whatever the reason, shopping for homes at a time when there are fewer buyers out there can pay off big time.

Second, **sellers are more serious and more motivated right now.** Most sellers have a compelling reason for listing their home during the holidays, which means they’ll be more open to negotiating. What you lack in available homes is offset by the probability that you’ll deal with a more flexible seller.

<br>Third, **you’ll get a more realistic picture of the home you want.** Let’s be honest—what home doesn’t look amazing during the spring selling season when newly planted flowers are in bloom and there’s plenty of sunlight streaming through the windows? Checking out a house during the winter season, on the other hand, might give you a more accurate idea of what you’ll be living with after you purchase.

In addition to getting a realistic picture of the house, you can check for issues you’d only notice during cold weather. Of course, keep in mind that the issues that arise during the summer will be less accessible to inspection, so make sure your home inspector does a thorough job.

Lastly, **you’ll have greater access to all real estate professionals.** Since December is a slower month all around, you’ll have more access to movers, inspectors, contractors, and mortgage lenders.
