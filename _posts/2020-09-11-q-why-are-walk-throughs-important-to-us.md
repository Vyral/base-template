Here’s why we offer a “Walk-Through Guarantee” to all of our clients.

When we talk about “walk-throughs,” we’re talking about the home tours we take of the properties we manage in order to observe any damage.&nbsp;

**If you’re an owner working with us,** we’ll do a walk-through before the property is occupied, another walk-through once the tenant moves in, and another mandatory walk-through either four or six months after they move in.&nbsp;

It lets the tenant know we are checking for damage, unauthorized tenants, and any pest issues. We take pictures, have a pre-checklist, and give our owners a checkup every four to six months after that. **It’s our promise to you and what we call our “Walk-Through Guarantee.”**

If you have any questions for us about what we do or how we can help you, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
