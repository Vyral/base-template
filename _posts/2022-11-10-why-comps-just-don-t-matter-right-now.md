If you're selling this fall, here's one thing to keep in mind: Comps don't matter. What I mean by that is the recent sales, say those of 60 days ago, are becoming irrelevant. **The market has changed so much in the last 60 days that the valuation based on those comparable sales is no longer applicable.** Interest rates are very high, and buyers' monthly housing costs have skyrocketed. Therefore, sellers need to keep in mind the buyers are going to be asking for discounts and concessions.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about comps or anything related to real estate, feel free to call or email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;
