I just wanted to drop by and send you a quick reminder today.

If you’d like to help keep a child happy this holiday season, I’ve got some good news to share with you. This year, our office will be accepting donations for Toys for Tots!

Stop by our office before December 16th and drop off any new, unwrapped toys that you’d like to donate. Your donation could mean the world to a child this holiday season, so come by our office, say hello, and donate anything that you can.

In the meantime, if you have any questions related to real estate in our area, give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
