Recently, I took some time to visit The HUB at 30A.

This amazing outdoor venue has a lot of covered areas and about **10 different dining options as well as several bars.** Additionally, there’s a shopping pavilion outside of the amphitheater.

The complex also holds a lot of events, typically as often as four nights each week.

This includes live music, movie nights, and football games shown on the big screen on Sundays—both of which really pack the venue in the evenings.

With as many options as there are for food and drink, including a nice wrap-around bar, it’s a great place to visit.

On top of everything, **the venue is very conveniently located**—right outside of Watersound just down from Rosemary. It's centered within the Prominence subdivision that offers new homes & townhomes on the market. You don't have to leave to entertain. Check out The HUB and Prominence today.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
