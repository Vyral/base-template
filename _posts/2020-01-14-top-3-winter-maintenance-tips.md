I’m sharing my three top tips for how to maintain your home for the winter.

Today we’re going to discuss how to prevent major expenses caused by winter weather. It’s meteorologically winter here, we’ve had our first snowfall. We know it’s going to get freezing\! So, we need to be aware and make sure all these things are handled:

**1\. Remove all hose bibs.** Put away hoses and place covers over the bibs if they’re older. (The newer kind don’t require a cover.)

**2\. Remove icicles.** They’re frequent in the winter here. While they’re sort of beautiful in a way, they are not good for your roof. If you are getting icicles on your roof, you need to find out why. Have a professional come to help, do not try to remove them yourself. Icicles will cause vast roof damage that can cost you thousands of dollars to repair.

**3\. Caulk windows and seal doors.** Walk around the outside of your home and see what else needs to be caulked, as well. Studies say that every house has approximately a 3-by-3 area of air coming into the home if you were to put all the cracks and crevices together.
