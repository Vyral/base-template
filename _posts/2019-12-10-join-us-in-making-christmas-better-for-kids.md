<center>This year, we&rsquo;re collecting toys at our office for Toys for Tots. We hope that you&rsquo;ll join us on the last day of the drive for a holiday celebration!</center>

&nbsp;

We hope all of you enjoyed your Thanksgiving pie from our recent Pie Day event. We had a great time giving back to all of you who have supported us over the years. Here at Jeff Cook Real Estate, we also love to celebrate the holidays by giving to those in need. This year, our Charleston offices will serve as drop off locations for Toys for Tots, and on the last day of our donation drive (December 17), we’d love for you to join us in a holiday celebration at our Oakbrook office on 10040 Dorchester Rd STE 101. We’ll have refreshments, holiday music, fun games, and more. Grab a friend or bring the whole family—and don’t forget to bring a toy\!
