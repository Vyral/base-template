<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the year-end numbers from 2019 and the current statistics from our market.</em></p>

Now that we’re well into the new year, it’s a good time to recap the numbers from our 2019 market as well as the current statistics. 2019 was a busy year, and a lot changed across the board. I’ll break down what happened in each area of our marketplace and offer insight into what it means for buyers and sellers.
