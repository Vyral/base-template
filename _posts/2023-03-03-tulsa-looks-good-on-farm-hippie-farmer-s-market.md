Wish there was an alternative to your summer farmer’s market during these cold winter days? You’re in luck, because this week Tulsa Looks Good on You is highlighting Farm Hippie Farmers Market!

A new twist on your local farmer’s market, Collinsville’s Farm Hippie Farmer’s Market offers local goods year-round, 6 days a week! With over 160 vendors, Farm Hippie offers a variety of food based items and beautiful artisan crafts.

‌

“To say we support local is almost an understatement just knowing we get to do that every day. We don’t just support local, we are local,” Ash and Carrie shared.

‌

Almost 4 years ago, owners Ash and Carrie Beth had the idea for their business and registered with the Department of Agriculture only to discover they couldn’t technically be a farmer’s market because they provided services indoors, multiple days a week. Jumping into action and getting creative, Ash and Carrie Beth engaged in the process to update Oklahoma legislation which now allow indoor farmers markets to be recognized as such.

If everything Farm Hippie currently offers wasn’t enough, they have recently launched a nonprofit leg of their business, Farm Hippie Community Inc. to continue to pour back into the community.
