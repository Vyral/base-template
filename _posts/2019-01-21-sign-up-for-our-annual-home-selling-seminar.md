<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our seminar is a tried-and-true way to get all the information you need for selling a home.</em></p>

Every February, we at the Dar Walden Team host our annual home seller seminar, and you’re invited! At this popular event, attendees receive great, timely information about the home selling process, best practices, and ways to sell for top dollar.&nbsp;

Selling a home is complicated, and we want to make sure you have all the pieces that are required. **We’ll have an appraiser, a home inspector, a lender, and a home warranty company who will each explain what they do throughout the home sale timeline.**

We like to hold the seminar in February, right before the start of the spring selling frenzy. This way, you can have enough time to get your home prepared for the biggest selling season of the year.
