**Looking for a unique way to spend a night out with family or friends? You’re in luck because this week Tulsa Looks Good on You is highlighting Pinot’s Palette.**

Jennie stopped by to chat with Pinot’s Palette owner, Lisa Riley.

After sipping a few libations including crowd favorites, The Bob Ross or Starry Night, the mood is set to have fun and get creative!

Riley explained,“We don’t teach technique, we aren’t here for art instruction. Strictly entertainment!”

‌Whether you are looking for a team building opportunity, unique way to propose to your significant other, or just a night out with friends Pinot’s Palette has you covered with three locations including, Cherry Street, Jenk’s Riverwalk, and Broken Arrow Rose District.
