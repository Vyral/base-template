I’m a pretty handy guy, so I opted not to get a home inspection on my current home. Well, two weeks after moving in, the gas stove was showing the error code FO3, which means it was emitting carbon monoxide. If I would have gotten a home inspection, I would have known about that upcoming expense, as well as the pool pump that went out. Even if you think you’re handy too, I always recommend a home inspection. If you have any other questions or would like more information, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
