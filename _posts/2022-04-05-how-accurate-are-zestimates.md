You really shouldn't trust Zillow's estimates. Zestimates give you an estimated value for your home, but these aren’t very accurate. According to Zillow’s website, Zestimates are only a starting point when determining a home's value. They aren’t an appraisal, nor are they a final answer.

Their estimates are based on public and user-submitted data. This means that homeowners can go into Zillow and add home improvements to their property which could make it seem like their home is worth more than it actually is. **These estimates are being tweaked and manipulated all the time.** Zillow even admits that more than three-quarters of homes in certain counties have Zestimates that are off by more than 10%.

To know what your home is truly worth in the current market, contact a real estate professional like me to give you an accurate assessment based on current market conditions. Reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
