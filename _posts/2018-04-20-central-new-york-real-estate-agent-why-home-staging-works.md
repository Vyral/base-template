Home staging is an underrated way to boost your home’s sale price.
Here’s how our friend and favorite home stager, Lorrie White, does her magic on homes.

I was delighted to be joined recently by Lorrie White of Lorrie White Staging Company, aka “The Secret Weapon” to talk about what she does and to see her work in action.

**We’re at one of Coldwell Banker Properties 6797 Dutch Hill Road. in Dewitt, NY.** This house has been on the market for a little while, and the owners have had Lorrie come in to stage the entire house. **Watch the video above to get the full home tour after Lorrie and her team did their magic.**

Did you know that according to the National Association of Realtors, 80% of homes that are professionally staged and professionally photographed will sell quicker and for more money?

According to Lorrie, **these are the top three things people need to know about staging a house:**

**1. Staging is affordable.** Many people are under the impression that staging is too expensive or not worth the money. It’s important to know that there are many different variations of staging. Lorrie is always willing to work with budgets, and **some home staging is better than no staging at all.** Even just working with a few key first-impression spaces can make a drastic difference in the presentation of the home during staging. Lorrie’s consultations typically take anywhere from one to two hours.

**2. Staging is not the same as decorating.** Even the best-decorated home can sit stagnant on the market for a number of reasons. They may be a little too taste-specific or individualistic. Decorating is more of a personal thing for everyday living. **Staging is done for marketing purposes** to help a product appeal to the most number of buyers possible.

**3. Square footage sells.** It’s extremely important to your home’s value. Certain things in a space can make a home feel smaller (i.e. large area rugs, dark paint colors, and too much furniture). It’s all about opening up your home, which Lorrie did wonderfully as you can see above.

If you have any questions for Lorrie or want to get in touch with her to see how she can help expedite your home sale, visit her <a href="https://stageitwithlorrie.shutterfly.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, follow her on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/happyhomestager/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, or give her a call at <a href="tel:315-420-9291">
