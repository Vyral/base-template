Today I have a message for investors concerning the possible capital gains tax changes. The Biden administration plans to potentially change the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 39.6%, but it’ll only apply to gains over $1 million. However, this hasn’t been passed yet. If your gains are less than $1 million, this likely won’t affect you unless they change the proposal to a lesser amount.&nbsp;

**If you have a rental house, investment property, land, or apartment building you’re considering selling within the next couple of years, it may be smarter to do so this year** to avoid paying almost double in capital gains taxes. Prices are high, and it’s a great time to sell right now.&nbsp;

If this sounds like something you want to do or have any questions about it, reach out to us via phone or email. We’d love to help you.
