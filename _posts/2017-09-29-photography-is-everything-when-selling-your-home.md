I’m sure you know by now that 90% to 95% of homebuyers begin their home search online. That is why professional photography is so important, especially in an island market like ours. Kauai is a vacation destination and many buyers are not here, so **photography is even more important.**

When preparing your home for the market, make sure that you use professional, high-definition photography. Have you ever taken a photo on your cellphone outdoors only to have the sun wash the photo out? With professional photography, you totally eliminate that issue.

We use HDR (high-definition realty) photography by taking three different exposures: underexposed, normally exposed, and overexposed. We then composite the exposures together so that the pictures look absolutely beautiful. This is the optimal way to showcase your property.

Some properties may also benefit from the use of a 3-D Matterport camera. This camera creates a virtual model of your home so that online buyers can tour your property from the comfort of their own home. This way, potential buyers can get a good feel for what the property is like in real life.

Of course, here on gorgeous, tropical Kauai, **drone photos are an essential part of highlighting your property.** Drone photos allow the buyer to see the neighborhood, how private the location is, and its proximity to the ocean. Drone photography can also showcase views from the home and how the property is situated near the mountains.

When you sell a property, make sure you work with an experienced agent who will use state of the art photography to highlight your home in the very best manner. Buyers definitely appreciate stunning photography and beautiful drone footage, so make sure you put your best foot forward in your listing photos so that buyers will see what a valuable asset you are offering.
