Congrats on listing your house. Now you need to get ready to show it off to potential buyers. Here are the three biggest things you should do to get your home ready to show:

**1\. Declutter.** You want the house to look like how it did when you went to buy it. It’s not good if the buyers can’t see past the clutter. If there’s too much clutter, their mind will start to wander.

**2\. Make the beds.** This may seem minor, but it will make everything look much tidier.

**3\. Put away dishes.** After cooking and eating, make sure all dishes and cookware are cleaned and stored away neatly.

Seeing any one of these things can make a buyer wonder about what else could be potentially wrong with the house and prevent them from noticing the highlights of your house. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you and help you in any way I can.
