<center>Mortgage expert Bob Reader joins me once again to discuss interest rates.</center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Today I’m joined once again by Bob Reader, a veteran of the mortgage industry, to talk about the present and future of interest rates in our real estate market.

There are plenty of misconceptions out there regarding this topic that we’ll clarify. Current rates are so low that they’re not sustainable for the banking industry, and we’re seeing this reflected in the financial markets. The bond market is increasing in value, which, in turn, will push interest rates up soon.&nbsp;
