So you’ve decided to sell your home. Most sellers think that after that, all the work is done, and then are rudely awakened by what seems to them to be a stressful process. What can you do to reduce seller stress?

With any luck, you’ve recruited a great Realtor. A truly great Realtor has the responsibility of carrying the stress for their sellers; **we’re the ones with the background, experience, and training to navigate most circumstances you’ll come across.**

In our experience, the times that are the most stressful for sellers are when they’re not sharing information with their agents because they don’t trust them or they don’t want to be forthright about what’s actually going on.
