&nbsp;

Today I want to take a look at Orlando. Why am I here and what do I love about it? Then I want to talk about why you should consider investing in Orlando as well.

I have lived in Orlando since 2001. As one of the major cities in Central Florida, **Orlando boasts beautiful weather as well as numerous nature trails, parks, and close beaches**. It is also only about an hour from Tampa and about 45 minutes from Daytona Beach and Cocoa Beach.

A topic that comes up regularly about Central Florida is hurricanes. Luckily, we are located quite inland, so by the time a tropical storm hits and becomes a hurricane, it loses most of its power by the time it reaches us. In fact, I've lived here for over 10 years and I've never had an issue with any of the hurricanes.

You should consider investing in Orlando for either your own personal residence or as an investment. You can **[learn all about investing in Orlando here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2018/02/01/full-list-where-to-invest-in-housing-in-2018/#5d4c6911627e)**, but I also want to look at some of the numbers with you.

The average home price in Orlando is still lower than the national average. **Currently, Central Florida’s average home price is $247,550, and that’s predicted to increase 9% over the next year** and 35% over the next three years. You can't find that kind of investment at a bank.

We are also growing by leaps and bounds with new construction all around. **The three-year population growth for Central Florida is predicted to be about 7.6%, while the two-year job growth is 7.1%**.

Other benefits of living here include no state income tax, which makes your living expenses much more affordable, growth in both the technology and medical sectors, and the VA Medical Center at Lake Nona. We also have access to national and international locations via our major hub airport, MCO. Along with everything else, Orlando has low crime rates.

Finally, of course, we are the “Happiest place in the world” with Disney World located here.

All of these reasons make Orlando a really great place to look at if you're considering a move or a second home investment. Of course, if you do need to buy, or you're interested in selling, it’s a great time to do so. Please feel free to reach out to me, I would love to speak with you.
