There’s a fantastic website out there for medical professionals and their spouses that will make the process of buying a home much easier. Here’s where you can find it.

Usually I talk about the real estate market, but today I have a special guest to talk about something a little different. Joining me is my husband, Dr. John Ramey, and we’re going to talk about our website, [drmoves.com,](https://drmoves.com/){: target="_blank"} and how it can help medical professionals around the country and in our community.&nbsp;

After John graduated from medical school, we settled here in Charleston and started Healthy Realty, a company that focuses on helping medical professionals find real estate. Over the years, we found that medical professionals are different than the average consumer when it comes to buying houses. **They need houses close to hospitals, they tend to have a lot of debt, and have a lot of other special needs that the average buyer doesn’t.**

[Drmoves.com](https://drmoves.com/){: target="_blank"} is the manifestation of our dream to help other families with medical professionals with their real estate needs. The website has several different search functions, including one that helps medical professionals find real estate agents who are experts in dealing with clients like them. We find great Realtors across the country and get them on our site. **It’s a completely free service that we want to provide to the medical community.**

Another big thing that the website does is help medical professionals find doctor loans. These loans can give you up to 100% financing so that you can buy a home without having your debt from medical school factored in. Another great thing about doctor loans is that they don’t require you to pay mortgage insurance, which saves you even more money. Most young doctors don’t have a lot saved up, so this type of loan provides them an opportunity to buy a home. The doctor loan is something our family has used in the past and it has helped us immensely.

**A new feature on [drmoves.com](https://drmoves.com/){: target="_blank"} is a service where we can help doctors find additional income.** There are a lot of opportunities out there for doctors to make additional income, and we’ve compiled a list of these on the website. They include doctor surveys, medical review companies, and being medical experts for attorneys in malpractice cases, just to name a few.

These are just a few of the things that you can find on [drmoves.com. ](https://drmoves.com/){: target="_blank"}If you have any questions about the website or if you’re a medical professional yourself and just need some advice from people who have been through it all before, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We will be back with part two of this discussion soon, where we’ll show you even more features of this wonderful site. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
