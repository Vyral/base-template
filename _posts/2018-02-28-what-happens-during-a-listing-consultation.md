What can you expect during a listing consultation?

Let me start by saying that it’s never too early to get your questions answered, so if you’re thinking of selling your home any time in 2018, reach out to us. Even if you’re not selling until summer, don’t wait until summer to get in touch. Give us a call right now, and we can do a listing consultation at your convenience.

**The listing consultation will start with us taking a walk through your home as if we were a potential buyer.** You are obviously very familiar with your home, but we want to look at things from a buyer’s perspective.

Once we’re done taking notes, we’ll sit down with you so that you can fill in the gaps and share things that are important to you in the home. We’ll want to showcase those things to the buyers.

After that, we’ll answer any questions that you might have about the selling process.

Lastly, we will recommend any improvements or changes that you need to make prior to putting your home on the market.

Sometimes, clients will call us and say, “Hey Chase, we don’t want you to come out to the house until I paint the deck or replace the carpet.” If you have some projects lined up, have us come out right now. You’ll never get any judgment from us. We know that even the best homes are not necessarily show-ready when it’s time for the consultation.

**Let us take a look at your home now—we might be able to save you some money.**Maybe you don’t need to replace that carpet or add that landscaping, or maybe the project you have planned won’t add any money or value to your property.

If you want to sell this spring, you should now that the spring real estate market is actually happening right now.

Give us a call to schedule your consultation today. As always, if you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
