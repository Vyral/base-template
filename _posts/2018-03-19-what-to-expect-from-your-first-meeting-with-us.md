What’s it like to meet with the Salas Team? Whatever your real estate needs, we are here to help. Today, I’d like to go over what you can expect when you start working with us.

**If you are looking to purchase a property, your first meeting with us will be a buyer’s consultation.** During this consultation we’ll discuss your wants and needs. We’ll go over where you’d like to live, what kind of property you’re looking for, and other specifics. Next, we’ll explain the entire process of purchasing a home using what we call our “home buyer roadmap.”<br><br>**If you are looking to sell a home, the process will also begin with us meeting for a consultation.** We will visit your property, discuss your intentions for the sale, and talk about price and value. We’ll also point out any areas in your home that might benefit from repairs or updates.

We want to know what your expectations are for us, and vice versa.

**If you’re looking to invest in real estate, we will meet to discuss your intentions.** We can’t help you unless we know what it is that you want. Understanding your preferences will help us best serve you.

No matter what your real estate needs, the last step of our meeting will be to explain all of our services to you. Because we’re a team, many different people will be assisting you throughout the process. We really want you to feel that we’re on your side.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
