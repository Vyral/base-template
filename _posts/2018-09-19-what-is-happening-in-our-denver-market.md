I recently sat down for a Facebook Live interview where I answered common questions about our Denver market. In case you missed it, I wanted to share it with you today so that you can also be informed about our hot market.

**The median price in the area is $400,000.** Although this has dropped some in the months since the spring, it is still trending upward since last year. We are going into a flatter market and are expecting a bit of a decline over the next few months.

If you’re a first-time homebuyer in the Denver area, you should start by getting in contact with a real estate agent. They can help you go over your goals and the area you’re looking to buy in and lay out a plan for you. The first thing we’ll need to do is get you with a trusted lender to find out where you are at financially. We will also invite you to attend one of our homebuyer seminars that we hold every six weeks in our Highlands Ranch office.

**If you’re looking to find the value of your home, you have multiple options.** One of the options is to join our email list where we send you an evaluation of your home every month. Another options is to visit our website, [**www.letsgohousehunting.com**](http://www.letsgohousehunting.com/){: target="_blank"}, click on the home value link, and then enter your information. Your third option, which is also the most accurate, is to call me so I can do a full CMA of your home.

If you have any additional questions about this, or if you’re interested in speaking with me about buying or selling in general, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
