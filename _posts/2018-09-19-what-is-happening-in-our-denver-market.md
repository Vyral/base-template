I recently sat down for a Facebook Live interview where I answered common questions about our Denver market. In case you missed it, I wanted to share it with you today so that you can also be informed about our hot market.

**The median price in the area is $400,000.** Although this has dropped some in the months since the spring, it is still trending upward since last year. We are going into a flatter market and are expecting a bit of a decline over the next few months.

If you're a first-time homebuyer in the Denver area, the first step you should take is to contact a trusted lender, as they will be able to give you an idea of your financial position. Next, get in touch with a quality real estate agent or team (like ours). Having the right professionals by your side will make a huge difference in your success. They will be able to help you go over your goals, and will also help lay out a plan for your success based on conditions in your area. We also encourage buyers to attend one of our team's homebuyer seminars, which are held every six weeks at our Highlands Ranch office.

**If you’re looking to find the value of your home, you have multiple options.** One of the options is to join our email list where we send you an evaluation of your home every month. Another option is to visit our website, [**www.letsgohousehunting.com**](http://www.letsgohousehunting.com/){: target="_blank"}, click on the home value link, and then enter your information. Your third option, which is also the most accurate, is to call me so I can do a full CMA of your home.

If you have any additional questions about this, or if you’re interested in speaking with me about buying or selling in general, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
