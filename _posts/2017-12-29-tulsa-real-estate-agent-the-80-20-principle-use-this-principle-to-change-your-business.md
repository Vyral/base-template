Using the 80/20 principle, we can ensure that we’re prioritizing our time to be sure that our money-producing activities are handled before everything else, which sets us up for success.

Today I want to continue my discussion of the six personal perspectives by focusing on another of them: the 80/20 principle. It shows up time and time again in our lives and in our businesses, and I really believe that there’s so much truth behind it.

**Pareto’s principle states that 20% of our activities will produce 80% of our results.** Simply put, not everything we do is equally as important. Because others have gone before us and done the research, we know that we need to **do our most dollar-productive activities in the morning** to make sure those things get done because that will help determine our success in our business.

Real estate agents and salespeople of any kind all have the same job descriptions:
• Lead generation
• Lead follow-up
• Go on appointments and negotiate contracts
• Practice and roleplay

I usually reword these and put them in the order of how my day usually goes. So instead, I would say:

• 8:30 a.m.—Practice and roleplay
• 9:00 a.m. to 11 a.m.—Lead generate
• 11 a.m. to noon—Lead follow-up
• Afternoon—Go to appointments

It’s crazy how this works and when you set accountability around it, it starts showing up, and your perfect calendar does start to come true.

Back in 2015, I took BOLD four times in a row. I did that because I knew I had to get into action and get things back on track for my business and for my team. During that time, I had five different role play partners, with a different partner to work with at 8:30 a.m. every morning in a different city. **That really helped increase my ability to talk better, know my scripts, be better at objection handlers, and it’s also a great way to connect with agents across the country.**

After practice and roleplay, I would go into my 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. lead generation. Early on with the new coach that I had, he required that I send him a text every morning at 9 a.m. when I got into my database. By sending that text every morning, I was certain to open my database to see who I needed to call to get into action and get busy. That one little text I sent every morning has changed my business over the past couple years.

**Think about what you are spending your time on all day long.** If you’re still a single agent, that’s super great—just make sure you’re doing your most dollar-productive activities in the morning. Everything else like setting appointments, making flyers, and doing inspections can all be done in the afternoon, after you’ve ensured that your money-making activities have been taken care of.

Let me know how you focus on your 20%; I’d love to hear about it. For any other questions, feel free to contact me by phone or email. Have a great day!
