If you have been thinking about trading up to your dream home, now is an excellent time.&nbsp;

Builders have been focusing on new high level homes, and investors have been turning mid-level, lower cost homes into rentals, causing the number of available mid-level, low priced homes to decline 40% in the last four years.&nbsp;

This has caused a shortage of mid-level, low cost homes.&nbsp;

The shortage is fantastic news for you as a seller. It means you will be able to sell your home more quickly. This summer, the typical home stayed on the market for just 17 days, and 64% of homes sold in less than a month. It also means you can sell your home for more in the current market. Prices are higher now than a year ago, and many sellers get more than the asking price.&nbsp;

Because the shortage of homes doesn’t apply to high level dream homes, you have a fantastic chance to sell your home above asking, and buy your new home dream home for a steal.&nbsp;
