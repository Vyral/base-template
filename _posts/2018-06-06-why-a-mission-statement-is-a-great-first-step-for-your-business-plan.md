Today marks the beginning of our series on the seven things that every real estate professional should have in their business plan. **First up on the list is a mission statement.**

Your mission statement should relay who you are, what you do, and what you believe in. It doesn’t need to be a thesis. **It should be short and something you can show to a client to demonstrate who you are and what you represent.**

One thing you need to include in the mission statement is that you want to make an income for you and your family. Not only will your clients understand, but you will understand that real estate is how you provide for the people in your life.

If you have any questions about how to write your mission statement or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
