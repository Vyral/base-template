In terms of getting a mortgage, **there are strong differences between a pre-qualification, a pre-approval, and a credit approval that you need to be aware of.** Today I’m joined by Steve Grossman of New Jersey Lenders to explain these differences.

A pre-qualification is simply when a loan officer interviews you over the phone, runs your credit, and gives you a letter verifying the amount you can qualify for. Other than checking your credit, everything else about your financial situation is conveyed verbally over the phone.

A pre-approval is more thorough. To get pre-approved, you have to submit your W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements to the loan officer. Your credit is then fully reviewed and vetted by that loan officer.

For a credit approval, you submit the same documents as you would with a pre-approval, your credit is run, the processor then processes the loan, and an underwriter reviews it. According to Steve, having a credit approval is equal to having an all-cash offer.

**The term “credit approval” isn’t brought up very often, but it’s what you should be looking for if you’re a buyer.** In a multiple-offer situation, having a credit approval will make you the strongest buyer. If you’re a seller, you should also be looking for buyers with a full credit approval because that’s the best way to protect yourself during the transaction.
