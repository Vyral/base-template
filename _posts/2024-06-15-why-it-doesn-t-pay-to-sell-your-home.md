Are you looking to sell your home soon? You might not want to wait. I work with sellers all the time, and I’ve noticed that they often underestimate how long it takes to actually get their house sold. That’s why today, I’m breaking down the home-selling process and explaining how long it typically takes to sell.

**First, offers typically take 30 to 45 days to close after they are accepted.** Second, marketing your home cannot be rushed. To get showings and offers, your home needs to be prepped, photographed, and marketed effectively. With these considerations in mind, people who wait until the last minute to list their homes often find themselves behind schedule. That’s why it’s important to work backwards from your move-in target date to the day you list your house.

To give you an idea of how things work when selling your home, I’ll share our team’s sales process:

**1\. Initial consultation and price opinion.** While it’s easy to get an automated house valuation, visiting your home for a walkthrough will give us a better idea of its worth. This also helps us develop a strategy to handle objections or lowball offers, which is crucial for pricing and positioning your home effectively.

**2\. Marketing plan.** If the price opinion and strategy align with your goals, we’ll proceed to sign the paperwork and start executing the marketing plan. This involves scheduling a photographer, measuring your home, ordering signage, and creating marketing materials, including a dedicated website. While these tasks can happen quickly, we aim to be thorough because you only get one chance to make a great first impression.

**3\. Preparing your home.** We want your home to be in top shape for showings. This involves preparations like cleaning, minor repairs, and staging. Our team has a network of trusted vendors, including handymen, carpet cleaners, painters, plumbers, and roofers. Making your house look amazing will attract more potential buyers.
