If you’ve been paying any attention to the Wasatch Front market lately, you’ve probably noticed that it’s been undergoing some changes.

In comparing this year’s statistics to those from last year, we can see that **there has only been an 8% year-over-year rise in the number of homes for sale.**

However, while year-over-year changes may not indicate much change, the shift we’ve seen over the past few months has been comparatively quite dramatic. In the time between June of this year and the present moment, there has been a 56% increase in our market’s available inventory.

Meanwhile, **the number of homes that have gone under contract in the last 30 days has decreased 20% since this time last year.**

So what do these statistics mean, exactly?

Actually, it’s hard to say what the future holds. But while I may not have a crystal ball,  I can tell you that if you or anyone you know of are looking to sell, now is the time.
