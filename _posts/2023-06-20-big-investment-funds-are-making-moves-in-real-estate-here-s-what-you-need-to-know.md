Buyers, if you're sitting on the sidelines hoping and waiting for the market to go down, you might want to pay attention to what Blackstone and some other big investment funds are doing.&nbsp;

**These companies are raising billions of dollars to acquire single-family rental units.** I don't know if they're going to start buying now or if they're waiting for something, but what that tells me is that these investment funds know inflationary times are coming.&nbsp;

Owning an asset such as real estate in inflationary times is a great thing. Therefore, **if you're in a position where you can buy a property now, it's something you might want to consider.** If you have questions about any of this, please call me. I'm happy to answer any of your questions and get you scheduled for a free consultation.
