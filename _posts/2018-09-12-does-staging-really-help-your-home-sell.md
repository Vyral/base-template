Melissa Samsell of Northwest Signature Staging joined us recently to talk about another common misunderstanding when it comes to home staging.

Oftentimes, home sellers don’t think staging is worth the time or investment, but research proves otherwise. Studies have shown that staged homes sell for 20% more and 88% faster than homes that aren’t staged.

There are plenty of different kinds of staging out there. Vignette staging is pretty bare bones and for a lot of agents, it’s as far as they will go. It’s where an agent will take a pretty chair or pillow and place it in the corner of an empty room and take a photo.

At Northwest Signature staging, they stage the entire room. If the room is vacant, we’ll add a bed, a nightstand, and bedding to give it a new home feel.

If you have any questions about home staging, feel free to reach out and we’ll get you in touch with Melissa. If you have any other questions about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
