When Walter Mischel passed away recently, it brought the topic of self-control to mind. Let me explain.

Walter Mischel was an 88 year-old psychologist who taught at Columbia University. His profile at Columbia highlights two things that he personally worked on: Personality structure and self-regulation.

Even if you don’t know his name, you might be familiar with his most famous work: the Marshmallow test. Back in 1960, he worked with 600 preschool children; the experiment was to see what would happen when the children were offered marshmallows. He wanted to know if they would choose to eat one marshmallow now, or if they’d be willing to wait to eat the first one if it meant they got a second one. Which would they choose—one marshmallow now, or two later?

One-third of the children in the original test delayed eating the first marshmallow and therefore received a second one.

How does this apply to savings and retirement plans?

I was recently watching a segment on Mr. Mischel, and one of the financial journalists doing his obituary immediately made the link to a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors entitle “The Report on Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households.” If you’d like to view an executive summary of the report, I’d be happy to send it to you.

On economic preparedness, the report says that 46% of adults say they could not cover an emergency expense costing $400 with their current savings, at least not without borrowing money or selling something to cover the cost.<br><br>On retirement, the study showed that 31% of non-retired respondents said they have no retirement savings or pension whatsoever; 27% of those respondents were aged 60 or older. Similarly, 49% of those with self-directed accounts like 401(k) or 403(b) were either only slightly confident or not at all confident in their ability to manage their investments.

Since Ted Bennet created the first 401(k) plan in the early 80s, we’ve seen a significant evolution in the tools that are available to get your employees support both those who are currently participating and those that have chosen not to.

Together, all these factors all help us figure out how we can help people save and be more successful with their savings.<br><br>If you haven’t reevaluated your tools recently, I hope you’ll think about these statistics at your own firm. A lot of employees rely on their employers for this type of advice and many participants didn’t know where to seek advice.

We can and should be more supportive in our approach to helping people use these plans. Many aren’t even aware of auto-enrollment, financial advice services, or the calculators and online tools that have existed for years.

Mr. Mischel, in a recent interview before his passing, said that he hoped to prove that with help, encouragement, and advice, our personality does not have to be set in stone; we can, in fact, change our outcomes.

If you have any questions about retirement plans, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to talk to you about how we can help you and your employees use your retirement.
