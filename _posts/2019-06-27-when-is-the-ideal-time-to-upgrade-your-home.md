Homeowners are often told that they need to upgrade their home right before they go on the market so that they can get the best ROI for every dollar they spend on the property. Today I’ll share a few recommendations that I make to all of my clients based on their time frame to move.&nbsp;

**If you’re planning to sell your home in the next seven to 10 years, you’re my favorite type of client.** I’ll get to talk to you, keep you up to date with what’s going on in the market, and make sure that you’re not over-improving your property. If this is your time frame, I suggest that you maintain your big-ticket items like your roof, flooring, air conditioning, appliances, and making sure that your paint tones are in line with current styles. By doing these upgrades earlier in your time frame, you can not only check them off your list, but you can also enjoy them while you still live there. Then, when it comes time to sell your home, you can feel good about handing it over to the buyer who deserves it.

**If you’re thinking about selling the property in the next five years, then your upgrades won’t be too far out of style by the time it comes to list, so just work on maintaining the integrity of your roof and appliances.** If there have been heavy rains or storms that have caused damage to your roof or landscaping, I recommend hiring an inspector to check it out.

Now, **if you’re considering listing your home within two years, time is of the essence.** That means now is the time to start attending to all the high-traffic areas of the home and to research the key upgrades that buyers are looking at these days. For example, do you need to upgrade the backsplashes or appliances? Do you need to start cleaning out your storage spaces? Selling itself isn’t hard—what’s hard is preparing the home to sell. If you know that you’re going to sell your home within two years, it’s a good idea to start chipping away at these projects one at a time and to begin imagining what your next home would look like.

Brittany, our buyer specialist, also has some tips regarding what buyers feel when they walk into a home.

Whenever she walks into a home, Brittany has found that **most buyers tend to like those homes that have been well-maintained throughout the seller’s stay there more than those that have had a few quick-fixes done just before going on the market.&nbsp;**

For instance, she’s had buyers who were willing to pay market value for homes that have black or even white appliances if the home has been well-maintained. On the other hand, she’s also noticed that homes with flashier stainless steel appliances won’t sell as well if they’re not generally as well-maintained.

**Homebuyers also appreciate homes that have been newly painted, but NOT painted just a few days before going on the market.** The smell of fresh paint can become overwhelming to some buyers. If you paint a few months before listing, or just touch it up over time to keep it nice for when it comes time to sell, buyers are more likely to rate that home a little higher and put offers on it. You don’t want to give the indication that you’re trying to hide something when you’re just preparing the home to sell\!
