title: When Is the Best Time of Year to Renovate Your Home?

excerpt: >-
  This week we are answering an important question one of our viewers recently
  asked: “We’re thinking of doing some updating to our kitchen and maybe our
  bathrooms—is there a better time to do that kind of work?” There is a better
  time if you are willing to negotiate with several contractors for the same
  job. It is a little like putting in a swimming pool—winter is normally a
  better time of year to shop for a lower price because contractors have less
  business. The trick is to work with one who does quality work and has a
  reputation to protect. To hear our full answer to this question, watch our
  latest video.
