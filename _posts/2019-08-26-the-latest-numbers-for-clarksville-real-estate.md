We haven’t talked about statistics in a while, so I wanted to give you a quick update today on what’s happening in the Clarksville market.&nbsp;

For a while, our inventory was going down, but it’s been staying steady at around 900 homes on the market. In terms of closed sales, we’re seeing about the same number this year as we did last year.&nbsp;

**At the same time, our average sale price right now is $208,900, up 7% from the $194,500 average we saw last year.** The market is still hot and active in all price ranges, but some areas are hotter than others.

If you’re looking under $100,000, we only have about 11 properties listed on the market right now. The $150,000 to $200,000 is the hot price range right now too.&nbsp;

From $250,000 to $300,000, we have about three months of active inventory. Over $300,000, we’re down to just four months of active inventory.&nbsp;

**Clarksville still has a great market and it’s a great time for buyers and sellers to be out there.**&nbsp;

As an added note, I wanted to give you an update on my journey to run a half or full marathon in each state. I’m now at state No. 47 and I plan to finish up in January of next year. Stay tuned for more updates\!

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
