Have you ever looked up at your ceiling vents and said, “Yuck?” We have, and today we want to offer a tip to help you fix the problem. Here are three easy steps you can use to make your vents look like new:

**1. Remove your vent.** In the video above, you can see that this can be done with an X-ACTO knife, a screwdriver, and a ladder without tearing the sheetrock. Loosen the two screws from the vent, find the edge of the vent, and apply light pressure with the knife as you move along the edge. This prevents the sheetrock paper from tearing. Once you’ve gone around it, use the blade to pry the vent away from the ceiling gently until it comes off.

**2. Replace or clean?** Small black dots indicate rust stains that are most often caused by humidity and moisture. If you choose to clean the vent, soak it in bleach/water mixture overnight. One part bleach and four parts water. If you choose to replace the vent, take it to the hardware store first to make sure the vent size and the mounting holes all match up. It’s a pretty inexpensive replacement.

**3. Return the vent to the ceiling.** After it’s clean, you can choose to paint the vent back on with painter's putty.

We hope this is a helpful tip for you. If it is, feel free to share it with someone you care about. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
