<center><em>John Tesh, national radio show host and musician, has endorsed our team.</em></center>

<br>Today we’re very excited to announce that we’ve been endorsed by John Tesh. Not only are we huge fans of John Tesh because he created “Roundball Rock,” the theme song for the NBA on NBC, but we also love his show “Intelligence for Your Life.” It’s broadcast locally on Sundays on 102.3 FM, and it gives us quality information that brings wisdom, peace, and satisfaction.

**We love his energy, his message, and his impact on this world**. We had the honor of meeting John a few years ago, and had plans to see him in concert this spring until COVID put a damper on things. We can’t wait to go back and see him in the future\!

**Take a listen to John’s endorsement of our team at 1:20 in the video above**.
