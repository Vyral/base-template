<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the three steps you should take to buy a home during COVID-19.</em></p>

This question is on many people’s minds right now: “I want to buy a home, but how can I do it during a pandemic?” I’m sharing three easy steps you can take to get this done in 2020.&nbsp;

**1\. Get pre-approved.** No matter when you’re buying, this is a crucial first step. You need to know what your budget and parameters are. Lending guidelines have changed a bit during the health crisis, so your pre-approval must be up to date. This also gives you the upper hand when submitting offers.&nbsp;

**2\. Virtually connect to discuss your goals.** Your real estate agent needs to know the locations you’re considering, the type of property you want, and must-haves.

**3\.Make a list.** Your agent will help you create a list of active properties that match your criteria and budget. This can be done easily; online you can view virtual and 3D tours before seeing the home in person. Then we can visit properties with social distancing and other safety measures.**&nbsp;**

If you or anyone you know has questions about buying in 2020 or real estate in general, reach out via phone or email. We would love to help you.
