Back when I started selling real estate 16 years ago, home security systems weren’t that sophisticated. Now, people can monitor their home from their phones, which means home sellers can record buyers who check out their house while they’re away.  If you’re a buyer, 99% of all sellers aren’t actively monitoring their home to hear what you say about it while you’re checking it out. I will say, though, that 1% are using information they see and hear to gain a competitive advantage when it’s time to sit down at the negotiating table.

Understand that we live in a multicultural area, and there are plenty of inexperienced agents out there who can barely write a contract. With all the nuances involved in explaining how buyers are being recorded, it's not hard to see how this situation can become clouded. That’s why you need to be smart about the way you look at houses. Make sure that you’re tactful, quiet, and you don’t tip your hat if you find a house you love. If they get a sense of your excitement, they’ll have a competitive advantage over you at the negotiating table.  If you have any questions or are thinking about buying a home, we have plenty of tips and strategies we’d love to share with you.
