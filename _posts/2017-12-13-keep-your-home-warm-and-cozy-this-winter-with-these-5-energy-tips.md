Here are five great tips that will help keep your home warm and save on energy costs this winter:

**1. Use the earth as a natural heater.** While it’s best to close south-facing windows in the summertime to keep sunlight out, if you open them in winter, the natural sunlight will help heat your home.

**2. Insulate your home’s north-facing windows.** Use heavy window treatments or insulated window treatments to keep the air from inside and the air from outside separate.

**3. Check your heating unit.**Dirt and a lack of maintenance are the two most common reasons heating unit failure. Before it starts getting heavy usage, have it serviced and change its filters.

**4. Turn down your thermostat.**Statistics show that by turning your heating unit down 10 to 15 degrees once you’re in bed and under warm covers, you can save as much as 10% to 15% in yearly heating costs. Better yet, buy and install a programmable thermostat.

**5. Don’t heat unused space.** If you have a guest room or a basement no one ever uses, seal that space off so it’s not getting heated when not in use.
