Down here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, we have plenty of waterfront property for you to choose from, be it river, bay, bayou, or beachfront.

There is a lot of interest these days in waterfront property. However, there are four things you should consider before buying or investing in a waterfront property:

**1.** **What is your intention or expectation for the property?** If your plan is to sit on the deck and sip your coffee while the sun rises over the bayou, that’s fine. There are a number of properties out there that fit that bill. If you intend to fish off the pier and catch trophy trout, or if you have a boat, that requires further discussion.

**2. If you do have a boat, what is the draft of the boat?** How big is the boat? We need to determine if you require a property with deep water access so that you can utilize the property the way you want.

**3. Inspect any existing bulkheads or piers on the property.** We don’t want you to buy something that’s been eaten up by worms or is starting to cave in. It can be costly to get those torn out or replaced, so we want to make sure your new bulkhead or pier is planned into your budget. It can cost anywhere from $150 to $250 per linear foot to replace, depending on how deep the water and how extensive the job is.

**4. What is the build elevation on the lot that you intend to purchase?** You need to get down to the planning department to find out. You should also look for other restrictions that may come with building on a waterfront property, as that can wind up being extensive and costly as well.
