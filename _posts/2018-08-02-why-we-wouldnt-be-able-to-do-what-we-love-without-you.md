Without you, we wouldn’t be able to do what we love every single day and have fun doing it. **For this, we want to say thank you.**&nbsp;

We’ve been able to help over 100 families buy or sell a home this year so far. What’s most exciting about this is it allows us to give back to our Tulsa community. Every time we help someone buy or sell a home, we make a commitment to donate to their favorite local nonprofit. On top of that, we donate to Keys to the City, which is a foundation that we set up that allows for strategic donation.&nbsp;

For example, we’ve donated $500 to Global Gardens, Emergency Infant Services, and the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma.&nbsp;

We also put together an event where we collected donations for Dressers for Success. Every time we host one of these events to raise money for a local nonprofit, we have so much fun, so **if you have a favorite local nonprofit, don’t hesitate to mention them to us.** We’d be happy to include them in this initiative.&nbsp;

We appreciate you very much, so if there’s anything you need from us or we can assist you in any way, give us a call or send us an email anytime. We’d love to speak with you.
