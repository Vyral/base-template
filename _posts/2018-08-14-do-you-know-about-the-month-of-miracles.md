This is a special month for our team. Here’s how we’re giving back to those in need through the Children’s Miracle Network.

August is the Month of Miracles on our team. You may have seen the “Miracle Home” banners on some RE/MAX properties, and it’s basically how we raise money for the Phoenix Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Miracle Network.

During the Month of Miracles, we get together as a company with the goal to raise $1 million pennies (around $10,000). Our team’s goal for this year is actually around $2 million pennies ($20,000).

**We’ve got some great events coming up that we’d love to see you at.** This Friday, we’re doing a salsa challenge at our office, and the following Friday we’re having an ice cream social. On August 24, we’ll be touring the Children’s Hospital with all of our agents.

Most people I’ve talked to know somebody who’s been treated or had someone they know treated there. They do some really amazing things and we’re happy to support them.

**Below you will find a PDF of all of the events we’re holding during the Month of Miracles**, and if you can’t make it out to any of them, no worries. You can donate through [this link](http://www.givetopchf.org/remax/pro){: target="_blank"} to help this great cause in whatever way you can.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
