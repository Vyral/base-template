If you’re considering selling your home and it’s more than 10 years old, you might be thinking about doing some renovations on it to prepare it for the market. Here are the seven most popular and cost-efficient renovations on the market right now that you can make:

* **Pendant lights:** Lights that hang from the ceiling in both the kitchen and bathrooms are very popular right now, and the best part is they’re inexpensive and relatively easy to install.
* **Kitchen remodels:** If your home is 15 to 20 years old, this renovation is probably on the top of your list. For countertops, quartz is replacing granite in terms of popularity. As far as cabinets go, open-shelf is the most popular style and white is the most popular color. You can also consider finishing off your cabinets with brushed chrome hardware.
* **Flooring:** If you have carpet, replace that with hard-surface wood or tile. The hardest flooring material right now is ceramic wood planks.

* **Smart home features:&nbsp;**Items such as alarm systems, heating and cooling systems, and window treatments can be controlled from mobile devices in most new construction homes. If you’re looking to replace any of these items, setting up similar technology might be a huge plus.
* **Bathrooms:&nbsp;**As with kitchens, white cabinets with brushed chrome and nickel are dominating in terms of popularity. It’s also common to replace a bathtub in the master bath with a new shower.
* **Landscaping****:** This probably gives you the best return on your dollar than any other remodels. If you’re not a big fan of grass, focus on crushed designer rocks and minor green shrubbery to balance out the look. It’s a very inexpensive and clean way to give your home fantastic curb appeal.
* **Stacked stones:** Having stacked stones around entryways and fireplaces is very popular. It makes those areas pop, and buyers really love to see it.
