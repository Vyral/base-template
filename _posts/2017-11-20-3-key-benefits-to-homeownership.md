Today I’ll be discussing some of the benefits that come from homeownership.

**1. Tax benefits.** There are several tax benefits associated with buying a home. Three main components of your home are tax deductible. For example, interest on your home mortgage, property taxes, and also points on your mortgage loan.

**2. Appreciation of property.** From 1988 to 2017, San Diego County has averaged an annual home price gain of 5.2%, according to CoreLogic.

**3. Increased net worth.** One of the greatest impacts on an individual’s net worth is owning a home. According to the Federal Reserve Board of Consumer Financing, the average net worth for a household earning $80,000 a year is $451,000 for a homeowner versus $87,000 for a renter.
