Today, we will discuss the current market situation, which appears to be as unpredictable as the weather. We're in an intriguing period because economic reports often indicate a strong seller's market due to low inventory. However, these reports don't mention the increased interest rates and soaring housing prices, making homes less affordable for many people.

While there is demand for median-priced homes, it's essential to understand that properties must still be priced at market value. Overpriced or luxury homes tend to stay on the market longer due to reduced affordability. So, **despite the strong seller's market reports, it doesn't mean you can ask for a significantly higher price for your property.**

It's crucial to remember the three rules: appropriate pricing, good presentation, and exceptional marketing. If these aren't followed, your house may remain unsold.

In many ways, the market is returning to normalcy, and some people are unsettled because they aren't receiving numerous offers shortly after listing their homes. It's important to be educated about this shift and prepare them for a more stable market.

Just as there's no "normal" weather, the same applies to the housing market. We are merely returning to more typical conditions.
