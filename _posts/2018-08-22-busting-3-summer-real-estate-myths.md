Today I’m going to debunk three of the most commonly circulated myths about the summer real estate market. Let’s get right to it:

**1. The summer is the hottest time of year for real estate sales.** This simply is not the case. The summer is a great time for enjoying summer vacation in this area, but there’s not a lot of occupancy here and rates are high. We use the summer as a great time to build relationships with our clients, live the lifestyle with them, then come back strong in the spring and fall, which are actually the busiest times of year here along the coast.

**2. Prices always drop after the summer.** In an appreciating market like the one we’re in right now, this isn’t happening. In addition, when the fall hits, there’s a higher variety of homes that come out on the open market and it’s a much more enjoyable time for people to enjoy previewing properties. Beaches aren’t as crowded as they are in the summer and it’s my favorite time of year down here.

**3. The summer is the most enjoyable time of year.** Although I love living here all 12 months of the year, the summer is when it’s most hectic down here. The beaches are crowded, there’s a lot of traffic, and people are on vacation. If you haven't been down here during fall, you’re really missing out. The water is still warm from the summer and it’s like you have the beach to yourself.

If you have any questions for me or you are looking at buying a vacation or full-time home down here, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
