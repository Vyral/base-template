Welcome back to another episode of “Your Journey with Jennie.” Today we’re continuing our look at the Five-S model of customer experience with the third “S”: Survey.

After you have set up expectations with your clients and are in an agreement together, you’re going to survey with them along the way to figure out how you’re doing. **This includes checking in with them and getting feedback.** If you’re implementing “The Promise” into your business, this is going to be part of your plan.

If we don’t ask, we don’t know and we won’t be able to correct any communication problems or errors to get better as soon as possible.

**There are plenty of different ways to survey.** One way is with a system to measure and survey your clients after closing. Another way is to use surveys and reviews online post-closing. This could be done through apps, websites, or you could create your own.&nbsp;

Feedback is so important because you never want to assume how you did. You want others to tell you. **If you do a great job and they leave a great review, that will attract even more business to you.**

If you have any questions for me about surveying or want to tell me about how you check this box in your business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
