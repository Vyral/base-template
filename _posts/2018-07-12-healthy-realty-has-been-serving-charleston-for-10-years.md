Healthy Realty is celebrating in selling real estate in Charleston! The secret to our success is focusing on health care professionals and helping our clients get their listings sold to this specific community.

As the wife of a physician, the medical community is near and dear to my heart.

I started my real estate company in 2008 at a time when real estate sales were truly struggling. <strong>This is why I decided to work into a niche and focusing on selling homes to health care professionals.</strong>

My team and I met with area physician recruiters and different physicians themselves in order to build our business. We specifically market to health care professionals moving to our area who might be interested in our listings. Our marketing systems, including what we do online, is one of the primary reasons for our success.

Our first year as a company was rough, but since then we have thrived. <strong>Our success has increased each year, and in 2017 we ended our year having sold around 130 homes.</strong> A majority of these homes were sold to health care professionals.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like help in selling your listing, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
