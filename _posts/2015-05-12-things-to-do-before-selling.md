The market is heating up in Indianapolis, and if you're thinking of selling your property this spring or summer, you will need to have it looking like a brand new home. Today we're going to discuss some things that you must do if you expect to sell for top dollar. 
Clean your home: It's just a fact that dirty homes do not sell. Clean your home in places that you've never thought to clean before. If you need to, hire a professional cleaner to come in and make your home shine.
Declutter: This is an important step, but also a difficult one because most homeowners don't realize how many belongings they have in their homes. Try to get rid of anything that you don't need to sell your home. If you need to, you can get a storage space to put all of your belongings inside.
Depersonalize: This ties in with the decluttering step. It's important that potential buyers are able to imagine themselves living inside of your home. When your home is filled with your stuff, the buyer will be distracted by it. You want potential buyers to be looking at your home, not your belongings. This may even require repainting parts of your home, because neutrality is important.
Curb Appeal: You want your home to appeal to buyers, and one way to draw them inside is to focus on your curb appeal. If your home looks nice on the outside, buyers will be inclined to look inside. This involves sprucing up your lawn, trimming hedges, planting flowers, cleaning windows, painting your door, and even power washing your home. Just make sure your outdoor space looks attractive. 
Repairs: Make sure to make any repairs before you list your home for sale, because you're not going to want to make them during your sale. Home buyers will also want to make sure that you've made repairs before they purchase the home, so make sure a certified contractor has been making them. This will give confidence to the buyer that your home is in good condition. 
Staging: It's a fact that homes that are staged sell for more money. We can come out and look at your home to help you present it in a more attractive way. We even have a staging service, so if you're trying to sell for top dollar, this might be a good option for you.
