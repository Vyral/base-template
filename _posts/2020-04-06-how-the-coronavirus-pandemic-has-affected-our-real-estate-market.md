Although the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted our daily lives, the real estate business is continuing to operate. Here are some of the latest numbers from the past few weeks.

As we all continue to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and its interruption to our daily lives, I’ve been keeping a close eye on the real estate market. As of last weekend, real estate has been deemed an “essential service,” so we are able to move forward with home purchases and sales. Some people that don’t need to buy or sell are holding off, but there are people out there who need to make moves now for various reasons. Inventory is still pretty low, as are interest rates, and that’s continuing to drive demand.
