I believe it is important for us to remember those who served and fought for the freedoms and opportunities we cherish every day. So today, I’m taking a break from discussing real estate topics to instead share my thoughts about the upcoming Veterans Day.

A couple of weeks ago, my father and I took a trip to Washington DC and saw its many war memorials. We went thanks to **Honor Flight**, a non-profit organization that flies veterans out to see our capital’s war memorials and monuments, providing them with a sense of honor and closure. We saw memorials from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea, as well as visited Arlington Cemetery. Seeing the changing of the guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier was a fantastic experience, and the amount of pride it makes you feel is like no other. **This is what Honor Flight wants to show its veterans.**

I’ve never served in the military, but I am incredibly passionate toward those who did make the sacrifice to protect our country. **Now is the time to reach out, and if you know a veteran or veteran family, make sure to thank them.** We’ve even created a program that gives a free refrigerator to veteran homebuyers. Although it’s only a small token, we always want to extend our gratitude to those who have served.

**We support our veterans and if you are looking to donate to a cause, we recommend donating to [Honor Flight](https://www.honorflight.org/).** They do everything they can to make sure that veterans can see DC’s memorials, because the reality is, many veterans die every day and many do not receive the appreciation they need and deserve.

We thank those who have served this Veterans Day. We invite you to take a moment to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
