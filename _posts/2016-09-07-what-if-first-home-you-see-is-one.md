If you fall in love with the first property you see, should you buy it or keep looking at other homes?

Some Realtors will say that if you fall in love with the first home you see, you have entered buyer nirvana. You can write an offer, move into the home, and they can move on to the next deal. I think that is a big mistake.

You may still wind up buying the first home you see, but I think it is still very important to compare that first home to other homes. In my 16 years as a Realtor, I have seen many people fall in love with the first home they see and I always encourage them to continue looking at other homes.

You need to compare that property to the others to see what you will get in terms of amenities, size, and finishes. You also need to pay attention to the location. Many buyers tend to overlook these factors, especially when they are buying a new construction home. There is something appealing about the fact that no one else has lived in the property, which makes it easy for buyers to fall in love with new homes.

When that happens, you may not notice that the backyard is not conducive to your family’s needs. You may also overlook the fact that the property backs up onto a busy street, which will be a hindrance when it comes time for you to sell the home. New construction buyers don’t look at properties this way, and they should.

Even if you are buying an older home, you still need to compare the first property you see to other homes available on the market. You may really like the first home only to discover that, for $10,000 more, you can get the perfect home for you and your family.

That said, you can take things too far by looking at too many homes and getting confused about what you want. I’m not saying to go out and look at dozens of homes; just look at a few others. This is probably the biggest investment you will make in your lifetime, so you want to make sure you choose the right property and avoid buyer’s remorse.

If you have any questions about finding the right home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
