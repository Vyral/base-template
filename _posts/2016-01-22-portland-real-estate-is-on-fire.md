**Do you have a friend or family member who is thinking about buying a home, or refinancing their current home?** I build my business by referral, so if you know of someone who could use the expert advise of a mortgage lender or finance officer, please forward this email to them, or reply back with their contact information and I'll gently reach out to them. If you have any questions about the mortgage and finance industry, please don't hesitate to give me a call. I'd be more than happy to provide a Consultation.

2016 is off to a great start in Portland. We are one of the hottest markets in the country right now. For the third year in a row, **Portland is listed as the number 1 one-way destination in the country.**

**This is also a great time for real estate values.** If you already own real estate, your home value has gone up significantly. It may be a good time for you to look at refinancing your mortgage in order to get rid of that private mortgage insurance or pull some cash out.

**If you haven't purchased a home in Portland yet, there is an amazing opportunity out there right now to do so.** Whether you need to get pre-qualified or pre-approved, need help walking through the different steps or getting in touch with the right Realtor, I would love to help.

Give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions at all. No one responds faster than me. Let's make it a great year, I look forward to speaking with you soon!
