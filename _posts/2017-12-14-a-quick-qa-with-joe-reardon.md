We had another opportunity to sit down with a great agent here at Keller Williams, Joe Reardon. Here’s what he had to say about joining KW and how his experience has been so far.

**Why did you choose Keller Williams?**

I got introduced to KW through some of the classes. I went to a career visioning class and also an expansion class. I ended up talking with the OP here, Marcus, and I decided this was the best platform for building my team. I knew I wanted to build it out further. What’s different about KW is they help you build teams in a way that you grow a business. Many other brokers in other places have so-called teams that are really just lead generation platforms.

What I’ve started doing here is growing a real, solid team that’s a long-term business structure with many different types of good lead generation and many different ways for these agents to be successful. The structures for the agents on our team were more beneficial for them in terms of us retaining them as team members because with KW you have that built-in structure on teams because it’s so team-centric.

**What is a common fear of being involved in a brokerage?**

For most real estate agents, once they get their license, they have this romantic notion of what that will entail that’s different than what the reality is. However, having said that, there are also many great things about it once you’re able to do it on a level that’s more than just sustaining yourself and putting gas in the car.

I think the fear is people coming into this business and being scared they’re not going to make it, and with good reason—there’s an 80% dropout rate for new agents within the first two years of getting their license. What they need to do is go someplace where they can get training and lay the foundation for being successful. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of places where you can actually get that. KW is a great spot for people to get those foundations, know the business, get business done in a short amount of time, and stay in the business.

**What’s unique about your practice?**

We have a unique background. I was an investor before I became an agent. Before that, I was a professional musician—my wife and I actually met while we were both playing Beauty and the Beast on Broadway. I’m a trumpet player; she’s a French horn player. Doing something like that requires a ton of discipline.

When we work with our clients, they know we have the discipline, the systems, and the strategies to get them the best outcome. We always make sure we get the best deal for our clients and their families. If that means we have to tell them to walk away from a house because it’s not a good deal, they know we’ll have the integrity to do that. Most agents run their business as if it’s a hobby. We run ours as a business, with the intent that our clients get the best outcome.

**What goes into running a real estate business?**

We already talked about discipline, so this means we have schedules and meetings. We meet with our agents every morning at eight and review what’s going on. After that, we’re on the phones prospecting and trying to find buyers for our listings and trying to find properties for our buyers. Then we have a team meeting at noon. From there we make sure everything’s going smoothly before focusing on our appointments. It’s a structured, systematic process that allows us to sell a lot of houses and take great care of our clients.

**If there a specific agent that you have helped grow and succeed?**

This is one of the things that’s really giving me the most joy in this business—not only helping our clients, but helping our agents be successful. We have an agent who’s joined our team within the last five months, and now they’re selling three homes a month. Before joining us, they only did two deals in the past year. I can sell 60 homes a year, but if I can help other people ignite their careers, that’s more satisfying. It’s enabling that person to live their dreams.They now have the skills and knowledge to help people and do this business on a high level with integrity.

Thanks to Joe for spending some time with us. If you have any questions for us in the meantime about KW or what it’s like to work here, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
