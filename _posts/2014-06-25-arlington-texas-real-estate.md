Summertime is here in Dallas and the market is heating up. Many people are getting ready to sell their homes this summer, so we thought we would provide some helpful tips on what a seller really needs to do in order to sell their home.

When you are getting ready to sell, you obviously want to have your home looking as good as possible. What i'm going to tell you today is probably a little different than you might expect.

The number 1 things most sellers think about when preparing their home for sale is curb appeal. While I agree that the home does need to look good from the outside, I would advise against putting a lot of money into the outer appearance of your home. **Let me tell you why.**

**90% of all home buyers start their home searches online.** Since 2008, we have used professional photography and professional staging for most of our homes because those pictures of your home that you have online are so important in today's market.

Having great curb appeal was the first impression in the past. Today, those online photographs are your first impression and our use of professional photography is what has gotten us such great results for our clients.

In terms of getting the rest of your home ready, I recommend we set an appointment together. We can advise you on what renovations or improvements to make so that you can **get the best return possible for your home. **

If you would like more information on how to get your home ready to sell, please give us a call. We look forward to talking with you soon.
