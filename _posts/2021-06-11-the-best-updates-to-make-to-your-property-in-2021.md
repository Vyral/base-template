If you’re a homeowner looking to spruce up your unit in 2021, what updates offer the best bang for your buck? The average home in Hawaii is usually anywhere from 40 to 60 years old—wow, that’s my age; I need an update\!&nbsp;

Jokes aside, you can’t just take your 60-year-old unit and put it on the market for rent. It won’t rent, and if it does, it won’t rent for a lot of money. So where should you invest your time and money?

**1\. Flooring.** Always put some vinyl product down in your house (tile is also an option, but it’s a little more expensive). If your carpet is weathered or your laminate is old, put down some vinyl; it’s not that costly and has a 25-year shelf life. &nbsp;

**2\. Air conditioning.** People that come from the mainland cannot take our humidity. Trust me, I know this from experience: I lived on the mainland for a while, and when I moved back home, I simply couldn’t sleep without air conditioning. Here in Hawaii, there’s a roughly 50/50 shot that you’ll find a home equipped with air conditioning. In my experience, the houses without air conditioning rent last.

If you have questions about these two updates or would like us to put in contact with some of our talented in-house handymen or trusted contractors, give us a call or send an email. We’re happy to help\!
