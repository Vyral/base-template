Today I’m excited to be coming to you from the Royal Oaks Villa Courtyard located just minutes from the Galleria in the Westchase District. **These fabulous patio homes, built by McVaugh Custom Homes, are absolutely gorgeous.** You can see what I mean for yourselves in the video above. 

When building one of these custom homes, you can choose between an open concept floor plan with two, three, or four bedrooms. Also, each property offers the option of including your own pool where you can relax and enjoy a private courtyard. 

Upon entering the home itself, you’ll find yourself in a kitchen that blends style and utility. Its custom cabinetry and appliances are all imported from Germany. 

Further into the property, you may notice that **you can still enjoy poolside views—even while indoors—as you lounge in the master suite.**

Next, his-and-hers sinks, a large closet, and spacious jacuzzi-style tub make for a comfortable and luxurious bathroom experience.  

Moving upstairs, the second level of the property we’re touring in today’s video sports two additional bedrooms, as well as an office. Of these bedrooms, one features two master closets with built-in shelves and cabinetry. 

Finally, **the entire home is wired with high-tech innovation in mind.** Guests approaching your home will be captured by the security camera at your door, and security and entertainment systems can be controlled through your television. We hope you’ve enjoyed this glimpse into resort-style living. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in scheduling a tour, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
