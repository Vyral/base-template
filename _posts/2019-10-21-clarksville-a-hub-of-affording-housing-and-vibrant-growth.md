We recently learned some amazing news, and I’m excited to share it with you today.

...has your suspense built up enough yet?

Here it is: **Clarksville, Tennessee, which is about 45 minutes west of Nashville, was just voted the No. 1 place to live by Money Magazine\!**

This is a great accomplishment, but why was Clarksville ranked first among the magazine’s other towns? Well, we have a lot going on here in our little town:

First, the average sales price across the nation is between $225,000 and $300,000. In Clarksville, even with the increases, the average sales price is $210,000. Comparing our average with what’s going on in the rest of the world, it’s clear that Clarksville is the place to be for those seeking affordable housing. And **because we’re in a military market, we may do certain things here that they don’t do in other areas.**

Second, after an ongoing process over the last year or two, our downtown is just starting to revitalize. Now we have a downtown commons, where you’ll always see people gathering and families playing. It has an ice skating rink, venues for live music, and there’s even an ice cream place nearby.

**Additionally, hosts of new restaurants have cropped up in our revitalized downtown area.** The Roux Americajun restaurant recently opened, giving the community an array of New Orleans-style cuisine. A few different microbreweries have also found a place in Clarksville. If you’re more interested in healthy eating, Clarksville now has several options

In the end, it’s not surprising that we were voted as the No. 1 place to live. We are really a growing community. I hear they’re even in talks to negotiate building another center downtown that could provide a space for things like hockey games.

If you’re interested in living in a vibrant and affordable community, reach out to me. I can tell you why this is a great place to invest in real estate and to live in general.
