For the whole year, [Scott Himelstein](https://www.instagram.com/scotthimelstein/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has been giving relevant, useful and **SERIOUS** real estate market update for his clients in Los Angeles. These tips have helped our clients navigate the intricate world of **buying**, **selling**, and **investing** in real estate. When it really comes to real estate, we want to make sure our clients have all of the information so they can make the **best decision possible**.

However, many times Scott will forget his lines, or a truck will pass by, noisy people will be in the background, etc. All these make the shooting of the videos fun and enjoyable to do. This holiday season, we have compiled these bloopers in a video in our hope to **bring a smile** or a laugh on everybody's faces. We hope you enjoy watching and have a joyous holiday season. We look forward to seeing you in 2022\!
