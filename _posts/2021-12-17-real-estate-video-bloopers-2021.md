For the whole year, [Scott Himelstein](https://www.instagram.com/scotthimelstein/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has been giving relevant, useful and **SERIOUS** real estate market update for his clients in Los Angeles. These tips have helped our clients navigate the intricate world of **buying**, **selling**, and **investing** in real estate. When it really comes to real estate, we want to make sure our clients have all of the information so they can make the **best decision possible**.&nbsp;

However, many times Scott will forget his lines, or a truck will pass by, &nbsp;noisy people will be in the background, etc. All these make the shooting of the videos fun and enjoyable to do. This holiday season, we have compiled these bloopers in a video in our hope to **bring a smile** or a laugh on everybody's faces. We hope you enjoy watching and have a joyous holiday season. We look forward to seeing you in 2022\!
