  Prices are high, but it’s still a great time to buy before they go up even
  higher.

Melanie and I are currently touring 10 different ports from New York to Quebec to experience the history of New England and Canada. It has been very interesting to see all the architectural styles and learn about the real estate history as well. We’ve been to high-end areas in Boston and now we’re in Portland, Maine, home of the Bush summer residence. At one time, this was the largest commercial port in the country and the city that Portland, Oregon was named after.

**Even though this area has a much different history than ours, the real estate market remains the same.** Prices are high, but it’s still a great time for buyers to buy before interest rates go up and for sellers to sell before prices go up even further.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or if you need help buying or selling a home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
