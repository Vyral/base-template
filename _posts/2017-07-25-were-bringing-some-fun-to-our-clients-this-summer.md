There’s a lot going on this summer in our area. Many events have already happened, but there are still many more yet to come.&nbsp;

My team and I are excited to be a part of that fun in a new way—we’re sponsoring Concerts in The Park, where thousands and thousands of people turn out to see some free music, have some drinks, and eat some food.&nbsp;

Coming up this weekend, July 29th, the next event is country-themed and family-friendly. The event begins at 7 p.m. and will go on until about 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., but remember to show up early so you can find a good spot for you and your family to enjoy the fun. **[You can find more information for that event here.](http://calendar.santa-clarita.com/event/double_wide_savannah_burrows_concerts_in_the_park?utm_campaign=widget&amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;utm_source=Santa+Clarita+Community+Calendar#.WXeuNYjyuHt)**

A couple of weeks later, we have another concert in the park on August 19th. For that date, you can come see more free music. [**The information for that can be found here**.](http://calendar.santa-clarita.com/event/40_oz_to_freedom_concerts_in_the_park?utm_campaign=widget&amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;utm_source=Santa+Clarita+Community+Calendar#.WXeuXYjyuHt) And then on August 25th—we’ll be doing Cocktails on the Roof at the Westfield Valencia Town Center. T[**ickets for this event will go fast, so be sure to grab yours here!**](http://cocktailsontheroofscv.org/)

This event, which has taken place for the last four or five years, **is a fun way to mingle, meet new people, and make new business connections. &nbsp;**

On September 7th we will be at the Salt Creek Grill for our Client Appreciation event. This will be a fun, laid back event where we can connect and give back to the people who support us. If you’re interested, [**please RSVP ahead of time.**](https://www.facebook.com/events/1391013464312644/?acontext={%22source%22:5,%22page_id_source%22:415210508563712,%22action_history%22:[{%22surface%22:%22page%22,%22mechanism%22:%22main_list%22,%22extra_data%22:%22{\%22page_id\%22:415210508563712,\%22tour_id\%22:null}%22}],%22has_source%22:true})
