The last 12 months have been an interesting time for the Tenafly real estate market.

**Tenafly has sold fewer homes in the last 12 months than in the previous 12 months.** To be exact, 198 homes were sold last year compared to 141 homes sold this year, a decrease of 28%. Fewer homes have gone under contract even though we have a higher supply of homes.

Another major driving force behind our market is supply and demand. Particularly in Tenafly, we have seen a jump from 6.4 months of supply last year to 12.3 months of supply this year, at the end of April. **This data shows us that we are moving into a buyer’s market\!**

Sellers who are looking to sell quickly and earn top dollar will find the greatest success by pricing their listing ahead of the market, while buyers can enjoy high inventory along with dropping prices by planning a home search during the summer months.

Of course, market conditions also vary by price point, as illustrated by the lack of inventory of homes below the median price points.

**Fewer homes are selling** and there is more inventory on the market. **So why is now a good time to sell?**

Even with the decrease in home sales, **interest rates have continued to come down** and there are many buyers ready, willing and able to buy. It is spring season and families want to get into the school system before September. Desirable towns, like Tenafly, with close proximity and transportation to the city, will always attract buyers.&nbsp;

How to win in a shifting market? Take all measures to ensure your home wins the beauty contest and the pricing contest. &nbsp; Position your home at a price that is compelling to attract all those buyers sitting on the fence. Price ahead of the market and leave less room for negotiation. You can’t negotiate a bid you don’t have.

Do a pre-inspection. You want to be transparent with your buyers so that you are not negotiating the price of your home again during an inspection.&nbsp; Buyers will move away from your home if the condition is poor.&nbsp;

Stage your home to ensure an emotional connection is made between your home and the buyer.&nbsp;

Ultimately, the best way to succeed in a shifting market is to hire **the right team** to represent you. &nbsp;
