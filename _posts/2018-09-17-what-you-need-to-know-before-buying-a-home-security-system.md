Having a home security system comes with both benefits and drawbacks, and if you’re thinking of getting one for yourself and your family, there are a few facts you should know before making a decision.&nbsp;

A study by Home Facts found that just having a theft deterrent was beneficial, but one of the main reasons homeowners decide against getting a home security system is the cost involved—there’s usually an upfront setup fee and ongoing maintenance costs. Between these two expenses, **the overall cost of a home security system can vary widely.**&nbsp;

Having a home security system should go beyond providing peace of mind and also make sense in terms of dollars and cents. An FBI study found that the average home break-in costs $1,725 in terms of stolen valuables and damage. Another study also found that one in four homes is likely to be broken into.&nbsp;

These days, **there are plenty of programs that are less expensive relative to the amount of monitoring you get in return.** You can also purchase an ongoing monitoring system so that when a door or window is open, the police are automatically notified. It’s all a matter of deciding which option is best for you.
