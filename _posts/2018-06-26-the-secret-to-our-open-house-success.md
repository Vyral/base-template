I’ve had a lot of agents ask me recently about how we have such success with our mega open houses, so I wanted to explain our strategy today.

We start advertising for our open houses about a week in advance. **When we decide to hold an open house, the home has to be right.** It has to have awesome curb appeal, and be within a few miles of some major traffic areas.

The next step is the marketing. We start that one week in advance on all the major websites. We have our ISAs circle prospect the neighborhood, let the neighbors know, and we send some direct mail pieces out as well. **We also do a lot of email marketing to our database of over 60,000 in addition to social media marketing.**

On the day of the open house, the most critical thing is that we put out a lot of signs. We hire couriers to go out and place signs, so all our agents have to do is show up to the open house, smile, and create some great relationships with some future prospects.

**Even if nobody buys the home or makes an offer, &nbsp;you’ll still have the opportunity to work with some new buyers.** We average about one new buyer per open house who actually ends up doing business and closing on a purchase with us.

Once the open house is done, the couriers take down the signs, and you can follow up with all of the great contacts you made at the open house. **I****’ve had over 85 people register with us at one of these open houses before.**

Open houses are still useful in today’s market and can really help you take your business to the next level. If you want to learn more about our strategy or if you just have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
