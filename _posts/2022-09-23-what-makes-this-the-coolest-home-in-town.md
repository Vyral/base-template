Today I’m showing you **the coolest house in Charleston**, 521 Cypress Point Drive. Its outdoor living space truly has it all: a built-in brick pizza oven, a breathtaking grilling station, a dining area, a big-screen TV, and even a bar. The home also has an outdoor spa with a hot tub and a gorgeous fireplace.&nbsp;

The beautiful master bedroom and bathroom are spacious and come with tons of storage space. Everything from the window bench to the closets offers plenty of room for jewelry, linens, and more.

The kitchen is an absolute dream. The sink is actually a complete workstation with cutting boards, knife storage, and a gas-burning stove. There’s also a coffee maker, a warming drawer for your mugs, two ovens, and even a steamer. **This kitchen has so much to offer**.

Moms will love the easy-access, well-hidden Christmas tree closet—it's absolutely amazing. One of this home’s most pristine qualities is its saltwater pool, which comes with an ANA filtration system and stunning travertine tile. If you enjoy fishing, this home also comes with a fully stocked pool, so you can fish from the comfort of your backyard.

This incredible home at **521 Cypress Point Drive is readily available for private tours**. If you want to see it or have any questions, please reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you.
