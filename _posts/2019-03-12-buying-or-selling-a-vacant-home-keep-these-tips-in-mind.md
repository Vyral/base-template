<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What’s the key to buying or selling a vacant home? Allow us to share a few key points.</em></p>

If you’re looking to buy or sell a vacant property, there are a few things you must do to succeed.&nbsp;

**Let’s start with the steps sellers should take.**

First and foremost: paint. This advice holds true for most home sales, but it’s especially crucial when you’re selling a vacant home. Unless your home is staged, buyers won't have anything to look at but bare walls, so make sure that they are fresh, clean, and neutral.&nbsp;

The next step anyone selling a vacant home should take is to spruce up their landscaping. Going the extra mile with your yard is fine if you choose to do so, but, really, all you need is to do is add fresh pine straw (or mulch), place a potted plant by your entryway, and pressure wash the exterior of your home.&nbsp;

If you want to make your vacant home look anything but, then consider taking the third step on this list, which is to stage your home. Professional staging can make your empty house feel like any buyer’s next home.&nbsp;

**Now, let’s move on to the things buyers should look for when purchasing a vacant home.**

The No. 1 factor homebuyers should examine in a vacant home is its condition. If no one has been taking care of the home while it’s been empty, deferred maintenance may become an issue. To avoid undue stress and expenses down the line, check to make sure the furnace filters have been changed, that there’s no wood rot on the exterior, and that, in general, the home is safe and structurally sound.&nbsp;

To ensure that this is the case, you’ll need to hire a home inspector. Home inspectors will be able to identify any and all issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. This will allow you to make an informed decision as you consider whether to purchase the home.&nbsp;
