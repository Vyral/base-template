If you’re thinking of listing your home FSBO or you already have, I have an important topic to discuss with you today. In our market, there are four different types of buyers. Understanding each of them is the key to making sure your home sells for top dollar. **Here are the four different types of buyers:**

**1. Serious and in a hurry.** These buyers are the most aggressive. Whether they need to get into a home because they just sold theirs or they had an unexpected job transfer, they are ready to make a move.

**2. Serious and not in a hurry.** Some of these buyers are homeowners who don’t have to move, but would if the right property came along. Some of them are first-time homebuyers who are proceeding very cautiously as to not make a mistake. {% include pullquote.html %}

**3. Investors.** If you’ve already listed your home For Sale By Owner, you may have received a few calls from them already. Most of the time, these buyers are just looking for a deal, so they prey on FSBO sellers and make lowball offers in the hopes of getting a deal.

**4. Looky-loos.** I don’t even know if you can call them buyers. Most of the time, they can’t even qualify for a loan and are just looking at homes for fun or to get some decorating ideas. They will lead you on until the cows come home.

When you look at each of those types of buyers, you can see that serious buyers are the ideal buyers. However, most of those buyers are going to be working with agents who already have listings to show them. They probably won’t even see yours if you list FSBO. If you sell your home on your own, it’s your job to know which buyers are which and help all of them. **If you can’t do that on your own, hiring an experienced professional like myself is the right move.**
