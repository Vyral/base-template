Every year, there are things that we should to make sure that our home is ready for the upcoming season. This is to make sure our house is well maintained. So for this spring, we have to make sure that our house will be as refreshing as the season.

First on the list are the windows, wash your windows on a cloudy day. If the sun is too hot, it will just dry the cleaning solution right away which will leave streaks on your windows. You may use a half cup of sudsy ammonia, one teaspoon of dishwashing liquid, one pint of rubbing alcohol, and a gallon of water.

Second are the sliding door tracks. You may not notice it at first but you’ll notice how dirty it is once you have the need to entertain people in your porch or back deck. Spring is the season to stay outside and surely you will have friends over to hang out.  You may scrub the tracks with a dry, old toothbrush to loosen the debris first, and then use a vacuum hose to remove the debris. Finish the cleaning with a wet sponge.

Third, do not take for granted the hidden areas. Clean under furniture and appliances. Move your heavy sofas and couches roll up the rugs, vacuum the floors. These hidden areas are most likely the reason why your house gets dusty so fast even if you’ve just cleaned the house.

Fourth, refresh your window treatments. If your curtains and draperies are not dirty enough to have them laundered, you may simply clean them by using the upholstery attachment on your vacuum. If you have sheer curtains, you may remove the dust by putting them in the dryer on low with a fabric softener sheet.

Fifth, dust your light fixtures. Use a lint-free or microfiber cloth to dust fixtures and bulbs that you can reach. Include your ceiling fans in the list, clean them by using a skip ladder or an extendable duster. For grimy bulbs, the solution is to dampen your cloth with a small amount of vinegar. But before you do this, make sure that the lights has long been turned off so it won’t be too hot to the touch.

Sixth and probably the most important is to get your home organized. Declutter your home by eliminating unnecessary stuff in your room before cleaning it. Try using different containers when decluttering, this will help you get organized in which to throw, to keep or to give. After decluttering, look around the room and double check if all the things that you have decided to keep is in their right places.

These are just some of the things that you can do to make your home feel refreshing this spring. Make a note to yourself though that you should also change your wardrobe since the winter season is over!
