For all of you wondering about our current real estate market, it’s still hot. We have such little inventory that **we’re desperate for sellers**. If you've been considering listing your home, now is the time to do so.

We have multiple buyers who are looking for options that aren’t available right now. For example, today in Sandy, there is only one house listed for under $100,000. If you’ve even thought a little about selling, let’s have a conversation. We can run the numbers for you and maybe even bring you an off-market buyer and save you some money. Interest rates are still very low, which will help you get into a new home.&nbsp;

**We’d love to discuss things with you.** Feel free to reach out via phone or email if you want to talk about selling or have any questions. We hope to hear from you soon.
