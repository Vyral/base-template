In a real estate transaction, a purchase agreement can be canceled for a variety of reasons, such as a botched inspection or appraisal. **When a contract is canceled and one or both parties become regretful that the cancellation is signed after the fact, what happens next?**

We’ve seen a number of cases like this over the last few years. One or both parties get cold feet, then they get cold feet again about getting cold feet. Here’s what we can do in a situation like this.

**The first thing we take a look at is if the house is still available and who we are dealing with on each end.** One party might feel hurt or mistreated, and it’s obvious that one party just hadn’t thought everything through when they canceled the agreement initially.

One concern a buyer might have in this situation is that they are leaving their leveraging power on the table by coming back to the seller. **It depends on the seller, really.** If they’re willing to reopen the door where things left off, that’s great. If there is other activity on the home too, that plays a large role.

**There have been quite a few situations where we’ve been able to resurrect a purchase agreement like this.** Hopefully your next real estate transaction avoids this kind of mess, but if it happens, we’d be glad to help you put things back together.
