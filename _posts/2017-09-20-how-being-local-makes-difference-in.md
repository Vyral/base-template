When it comes to real estate, the same thing doesn’t work in every area. Real estate is local, and it needs to be treated that way.

Today I want to discuss the fact that real estate is local.

Real estate is widely different from other products and the way they’re sold. For example, if you’re selling a box of cereal, you can put it on shelves in Los Angeles and Columbia and it’s going to meet the exact same market demand in both places.

This isn’t the case for real estate. Real estate is going up and seeing a lot of action right now, but this wasn’t always the case. A lot of agents in the recession were struggling to find work and were taking on part-time jobs as a way to supplement their income.

I think it’s worth mentioning that here on the Lance Woodley team, **we actually doubled our business during that time.**

Now that we’re doing well, a lot of agents from outside of our area are coming in thinking that real estate here will be easy. However, real estate is never easy.

Imagine you’ve got an agent from Greenville, Charleston, or even somewhere out of state. Now, they want to try moving into the Midlands to find work here. They may have done a good job in their previous markets, but real estate isn’t the same as other products. **The same thing doesn’t work for every market.**

Real estate is local. If you are looking to complete a real estate transaction, it is absolutely essential that you work with a local expert who knows the nuances of the area. Someone can’t simply move somewhere and immediately expect to have the same knowledge as an agent who is truly local.

**The Lance Woodley team has been successfully selling real estate for over 25 years in this area.** If you want to sell fast and for top dollar, don’t be fooled by the new guy on the block. I highly recommend that you work with us and let us provide you with the best service possible.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
