If you’re thinking of applying for a mortgage, I’ve brought in professional lender Jim Dildine of Bank of England Mortgage to answer a couple questions you might have.

**Do you need to save a lot of money for your down payment?**

According to Jim, a large down payment would have been required to secure a loan many years ago, but this is no longer the case. Nowadays, there are several loan options that require little-to-no money down, and you don’t have to be a first-time homebuyer to take advantage of them. If you’re a veteran, for instance, you can buy a home with no money down.

**What are the first steps of getting pre-approved?**

First, you need to fill out a loan application, which can be done online or by talking with a lender over the phone or in person. This process typically only takes five to 10 minutes, and once that’s done, you’re ready to start searching for homes.

If you have any more mortgage questions for Jim, you can give him a call at (208) 703-9696 or visit his website [www.JimDildine.com.](www.jimdildine.com){: target="_blank"}

As always, if you have any real estate questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, feel free to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
