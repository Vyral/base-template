Today, I'm going to **take you on a tour of Old Village Mt. Pleasant**. One of my favorite things about Old Village is the architecture. At 0:15 in the video, you can see that there are newly designed homes right next to some old brick ranches. There’s a gorgeous new custom house right next to this brick ranch that was just purchased for $850,000, and is currently being remodeled.&nbsp;

One of the coolest parts of Old Village is the Pit Street Bridge. It has beautiful views of Charleston Harbor, and people love to take walks and enjoy this great space. Downtown Old Village is also home to the renowned Post House restaurant, which has amazing food.

Lastly, Old Village has Alhambra Hall, where great events are held. It’s right across the street from Alhambra Park, where I used to bring my kids to play when they were little. **This is a gorgeous area**. I hope you get a chance to come and check out what Old Village has to offer.

As always, if you have any questions about this location or have any real estate-related concerns, call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
