Did you know that fall is actually the second-best time of the year to list your home on the market? With summer ending and fall fast approaching, that means that now is a great time to list your home.

If you are looking to sell, you have a window of opportunity after children have returned to school and before Thanksgiving to get it done. After Thanksgiving, the market starts to slow down, so if you are thinking about selling, or if you really need to get on the market and get it sold, now's the time.

Even if you want to go on the market later during the winter months, get your exterior pictures done now to utilize the lush green grass and leaves of summer to make your photos really shine. Also, get your prep work completed before hitting the market. We have a stager who meets with all of our clients and can give you an overview of how to declutter, depersonalize, and neutralize the house.

**Inventory is down about 20%, and sales are up about 1% since last year**. Townhouses are up about 8% in Harford County and 3% in Baltimore County. Also in Baltimore County, detached homes are up 2%. Overall, it is a busy season with less inventory and interest rates holding strong.

If you have any questions about selling, or if you are interested in buying, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
