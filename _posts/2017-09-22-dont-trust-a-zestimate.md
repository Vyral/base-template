Do you have a friend who uses WebMD when they are sick to diagnose them without consulting a doctor at all? **That’s kind of like using Zillow to get the value of your home without speaking to a real estate agent.** You might be right, but chances are that you’re not. In fact, you might be way off.

Zillow and its Zestimates are good for getting a ballpark figure for what your home is worth, but you’re not really getting the truth. **The only way to get your home’s true value is by contacting a Realtor to have them come take a look at the home in person.** They will be able to assess the home’s location, condition, and all of its upgrades. Zillow doesn’t look at any of this, even though it plays such a vital role in determining your home’s value.

If you’d like a complete market analysis done for your home that will let you know exactly what its market value is right now, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be more than happy to help.
