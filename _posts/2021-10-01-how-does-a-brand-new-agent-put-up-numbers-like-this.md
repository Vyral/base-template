We have a question for you. **How is it possible that a brand-new, first-year agent is set to take home $164,737 in commission with three months left to go in 2021?&nbsp;**

On our team, it’s all about our lead-generation systems. Just last month, between our eight agents, we had 167 leads and over 200 inbound phone calls from prospects. We feed our team massive amounts of leads while also training them to convert.

If you’ve been thinking about joining a team to kickstart your real estate journey or get back on track, we would love to hear from you. **Reach out, give us a call, and we would love to have a confidential conversation about how joining our team could help take your career to the next level.**

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
