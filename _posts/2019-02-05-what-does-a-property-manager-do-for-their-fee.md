To help us understand what a property manager does to earn their fee, I invited **Victor Cortese of PPS Properties** to speak with us today. As a property manager himself, he knows the ins and outs of the business.

So, what does a property manager do? **Their key duties include:**

* Collecting rent
* Managing the accounting process
* Distributing statements
* Fielding tenant calls for work orders, tenant management issues, etc.

PPS Properties also goes above and beyond these typical duties, **performing an annual preventative maintenance check to keep issues from occurring.** They’ll look at oil burners, electrical systems, and water pipes during their maintenance. This also helps with their turnover costs at the end of the day.

<br>I’d like to thank Victor for joining us today; you can visit his company’s website at [www.PPS.Properties](http://www.PPS.Properties){: target="_blank"}. And if you have any real estate questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
