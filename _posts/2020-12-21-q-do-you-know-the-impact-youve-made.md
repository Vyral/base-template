*You’ve made all this positive change possible*

It’s been an amazing year for Jeff Cook Cares. 2020 was full of unexpected challenges, and there was no shortage of needs to fill in the community. We’re proud to announce that, with your help, we were able to raise a total of $70,000 to build seven homes in Peru and Nicaragua for families in need\! Our golf tournament alone brought in $8,400 for Buy a Home, Give a Home. When disaster struck, Jeff Cook Cares volunteers contributed 500 hours toward tornado relief efforts. To see a highlight reel of everything we were able to accomplish this year, watch this short video.
