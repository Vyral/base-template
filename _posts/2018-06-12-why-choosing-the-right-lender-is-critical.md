What’s the key to choosing the right lender? This is a question I hear all the time.

Between credit unions, FDIC banks, mortgage banks like mine, and other brokers, it can be hard to know which is best for your needs.

One thing I will say is that my team and I have an outstanding reputation within the industry. And this reputation goes a long way in benefitting our clients.

For example: With market conditions as hot as they are right now, multiple offer situations are very common. **Our team is able to leverage our reputation and help get your offer accepted above others.**

When we reach out to listing agents and vouch for our clients, they truly value our opinion. In fact, we were recently able to help a buyer win out against seven others while offering $5,000 less than the highest offer. We were also able to help them close in just 14 days.

So when choosing a lender, make sure you work with someone who has the skills and reputation to help you succeed.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how I could serve you as a lender, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
