What is the difference in cost in buying versus renting a home?

The answer may surprise you. Though many **people tend to assume that renting is the cheaper option**, this isn’t always the case.

Alongside the many other benefits of homeownership, it may actually be more cost-efficient for you to buy than to rent.

In fact, the percentage of income required **to afford median rent is about 29.2%**. The percentage of **income needed to afford a median home, however, is just 15.8%**.

This is a significant difference. If you’ve been renting simply because you think you can’t afford a home, you may want to reconsider.

If the issue is that you’re worried about paying your own maintenance costs, consider this: your landlord has already factored maintenance into your rent.

You’re paying a mortgage either way, so why not pay your own?

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
