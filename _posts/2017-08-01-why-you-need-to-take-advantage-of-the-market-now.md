Whether you’re a buyer or seller, I have important news to share with you. &nbsp;

Interest rates, as we know, have been on the rise. Why does this matter? &nbsp;

If you’re a buyer and rates go up just 1%, you’ll lose 10% of your buying power. This means you may have to settle for not living in the neighborhood you want or giving up that pool you wanted. That’s not what you want, right? I know that’s not what I want for you.

If you’re a seller, rising interest rates mean fewer buyers can afford your home. Fewer buyers mean fewer offers.

There was a study published recently that no one’s talking about but I think you deserve to know about. The study showed that in South Florida, there’s less than a 10% chance that our real estate prices will decrease in the next two years.

As a buyer, you might have both higher interest rates and higher prices, and that’s not good for anybody.

We are here to help you capitalize on the opportunity in the current market, so if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.
