There are a few unique challenges that homeowners who choose to sell their own homes go through. When you decide to sell your home as an FSBO (For Sale By Owner), you need to be able to work through these challenges.

**One of those challenges is trying to absorb the vast amount of information needed to sell a home for top dollar**. When buyers come to look at your home, they will undoubtedly have questions about the surrounding properties and area. Do you have that information? What specifically sets your home apart?

Another big challenge is operating on a schedule. FSBOs tend to operate on the seller’s schedule, which is usually not conducive to the buyer. You need to be available on the buyer’s term to have a successful outcome.

Separating your emotions from the business can also be tough. Your emotions are connected to the home and most of the time the outcome might not be to your advantage. **We can help you separate the business from the emotions in order to help you have a better outcome**.
