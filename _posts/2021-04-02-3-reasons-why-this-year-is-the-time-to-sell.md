Here are the top three reasons to sell your home in 2021:

**1\.** You have the best opportunity to net the most money from your sale that I’ve ever seen.&nbsp;

**2\.** Due to high demand and low supply, you can more easily dictate your terms, conditions, and timeline to buyers.&nbsp;

**3\.** You don’t have to negotiate as much over repairs and inspections. This doesn’t mean you’ll always get an as-is sale, but you likely won’t have to make as many concessions. If the buyer cancels their offer, you’ll probably have several other offers to choose from.

If you’d like to know more about what a home sale can do for you in 2021, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.<br>&nbsp;
