When you're selling your home, there are certain things you can do to avoid issues with the inspection. Today, I'm joined by Greg Watkins with&nbsp;**[Advance Look Inspections](http://www.advancelookinspections.info/index.html)**&nbsp;to help me explain this topic.

You obviously want your home to be in tip-top shape when buyers come through.&nbsp;**There are some things you can take care of in the home before the inspection even occurs.**&nbsp;According to Greg, curb appeal means a lot as a buyer approaches your house, so keep your shrubbery trimmed with 12 inches of clearance from the house. Doing so will also help prevent pests from getting into your home.

Additionally, don't overlook areas of wood rot, which can take place in 95% of the house. Most wood rot, Greg, says, comes from gutters that aren't clean and cause water intrusion. If you have backed up gutters, it will show up on the home inspection. This issue can cause wood rot all the way down the side of your house, including the siding, the soffit, the trim, and the fascia.

When it comes to the HVAC system, you need to change your filters, and Greg recommends that you monitor it for the first few months after you move into a house to get an idea of how much dust is in your house. Some people have a lot of dogs and don't realize how much debris can build up, Greg says.

**Any areas that look dingy should be repainted, and it always helps to clean your windows.**&nbsp;You might want to do some serious scrubbing to determine whether your windows are dirty or have a defective seal.

As for pre-list inspections, Greg says that he'll do the same inspection that he would do for a home buyer. It will include the foundation, the siding, the roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC system. As Greg says, it may save you time and money and makes everyone's life a little bit easier.

If you're in need of a home inspection either as a home buyer or seller, you can reach Greg at **919-523-9241.**
