Today, I sat down with Mike Mihulka, a mortgage lender for Blackridge Bank, and got the opportunity to ask him about who he is, how long he’s been in the business, and what kind of programs he concentrates on.

**JQ: Mike, how long have you been doing lending in the FM area?**

MM: I’ve been in the mortgage industry for about 10 years. I’ve been working for Blackridge for about three of them, now.

**JQ: What kinds of programs do you focus on?**

MM: We deal with all the major programs: conventional, FHA, VA, USDA. We deal with a lot of first-time home buyers, so the North Dakota as well as the Minnesota First-Time Buyer Program, which is great for down payment assistance. We deal with the USDA for rural properties, which is a very popular program. For military personnel, we have our VA program.

**JQ: That’s great! It sounds like you’ve got plenty of options. If someone wanted to reach you for answers to their mortgage or lending questions, how would they do that?**

MM: You can reach me here, at Blackridge Bank. My phone number is (701) 364-9064, or you can drop me an email at [mike.mihulka@blackridgebank.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,105,107,101,46,109,105,104,117,108,107,97,64,98,108,97,99,107,114,105,100,103,101,98,97,110,107,46,99,111,109))).
