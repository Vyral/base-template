It’s been reported that in the US, a home is robbed every 14.6 seconds.&nbsp; The average loss is just a little over $2,000.&nbsp; So, if you have a $1,000 deductible on your homeowner’s insurance policy, only half of your loss would be covered.

Here are some strategies for keeping your home safe from would-be thieves:

**Tear up cardboard boxes –&nbsp;**There’s no better way for thieves to see that you just bought a new TV, computer, microwave, than by the empty box that is left alongside the trash containers.&nbsp; Tear/cut them up and bundle them so they are inconspicuous.

**Lock doors and windows –&nbsp;**It may seem obvious, but most thieves gain access through open doors and windows that someone forgot to lock.

**Don’t hide your keys in the obvious places –&nbsp;**Thieves look for the “fake rock.”&nbsp; The ledge above the door.&nbsp; The doormat.&nbsp; Consider leaving it with a neighbor, or in a less conspicuous location.

**Don’t announce your plans on social network sites –&nbsp;**While you may be excited to share your vacation plans (or going out of town for a wedding or funeral), don’t announce the dates you will be leaving and returning.&nbsp; Wait till you return to post your pictures.

**Do a little landscaping –&nbsp;**Cut back bushes and trees that may hide windows and doors which may also hide a thief from view.

**Replace light bulbs –&nbsp;**Another obvious strategy, but a well-lighted house will thwart thefts.

**Close drapes/blinds –&nbsp;**Giving someone a clear view of what you have inside can be trouble.&nbsp; Even if you are leaving your home for a short period of time, close the drapes or blinds so thieves can’t see what you own.

Just a little prevention can save you money, as well as the heartache of someone violating your private space.
