If you haven’t already heard, Zillow has an estimate feature on their website. They call this feature a Zestimate.&nbsp;

When it comes to pricing their home, clients bring up their Zestimates all the time. However, many people may not entirely understand what a Zestimate truly is.

The **Zestimate is based on an algorithm Zillow developed to determine estimated home values.** However, Zestimates aren’t always accurate.

Unfortunately, Zillow simply can’t measure certain important factors that go into your home’s value.&nbsp;

If your home is in the kind of neighborhood where all the homes look exactly alike, a Zestimate might be a bit more accurate.

However, **anywhere else and you may run into a few different issues.** This is especially the case if you live in a rural area.&nbsp;

There are a number of other things the Zestimate can’t take into account. Any upgrades to kitchens or bathrooms, for example, won’t be factored into a home’s Zestimate.&nbsp;

These types of things can add a ton of value to a home. Zillow simply can’t measure certain key factors. This becomes a huge issue in the accuracy of the Zestimate—because these factors really add up.

At The Dailey Group, we want to help. **We provide custom valuations by taking into account the things Zillow simply can't.**

If you’re interested in that, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
