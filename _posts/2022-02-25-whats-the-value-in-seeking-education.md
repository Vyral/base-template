If you’re an agent, seeking education is critical. Things are changing all the time, so it’s important to stay on top of what’s happening in the industry and the marketplace. If you don't stay up to date with technology and the latest changes, you’ll fall behind.

**Here’s an example:** As of April 1, Fannie Mae will make changes regarding above-grade and below-grade square footage. If you have a split-level or bi-level, they will no longer count the square footage that’s below grade, so be sure to let your buyers know about this change and have them get their appraisals done before April 1.

That’s the kind of information you need to know as an agent or investor. The appraiser can give you an adjustment for having a finished basement, but they will no longer be counting it as square footage, even if you have an egress window.

**At the end of the day, you always have to be willing to change.** Supply and demand will keep prices up for the foreseeable future, and I think things will adjust after a few months.

If you have any questions for me about upcoming changes from Fannie Mae, how to seek education as an agent, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
