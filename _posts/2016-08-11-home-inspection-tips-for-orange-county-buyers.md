Today we’re here with everything you need to know about home inspections.

You pick who you work with. Most Realtors have worked with the same home inspector over and over again. That’s because they probably tried a few out until they found one that they really like and trust. You’re welcome to use someone your Realtor recommends, or you can ask friends who recently bought or sold a home for recommendations.

**What are they looking for?** When a home inspector comes out to the property, it usually takes about two to four hours for them to do a really thorough job. The inspector will look at structural integrity and systems like heating, plumbing, and electrical to see if there are any issues. They will also look for foundation or roof issues.

You can show up during the last half hour and walk around with the inspector. He will point out what he found and he will also send a report after the inspection is complete. The report should include pictures. The inspector will also note any safety concerns, major repairs, or minor cosmetic flaws.<br>Once you receive that report, your agent will go through it with you, line by line, to point out which items should be addressed in your request for repairs.

**Keep in mind that the inspector doesn’t cover everything.** The termite inspection is separate from the home inspection, and sewer line inspections are separate as well. If there is a big crack in the pool, a water leak protection company will need to come out for a more in-depth pool inspection.<br>If you have any questions about home inspections or about real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email.
