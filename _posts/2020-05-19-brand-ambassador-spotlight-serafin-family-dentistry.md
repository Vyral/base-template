Serafin Family Dentistry will bring a (refined) smile to your face.

For this edition of our Brand Ambassador spotlight, I’m joined by Dr. Tamara Shore to learn more about Serafin Family Dentistry and their spot here in the Carlisle community.&nbsp;

Serafin Family Dentistry purchased their office in 2001, convinced that Carlisle was a center from which to help people with their oral health and overall dental care. **“The truth is,” Dr. Shore said, “we just feel so strongly that nothing is better than a beautiful smile.”&nbsp;**

A true general practice dentistry, Serafin Family Dentistry sees patients of all ages to provide routine or preventive care, dental implants, advanced replacement of lost teeth, and more. They’ve helped me with some tooth sensitivity and grinding issues I’ve had over the years, and I couldn’t be happier. They also offer amazing cosmetic options like whitening\!

Dr. Shore said that the most common questions clients ask are regarding their dental insurance benefits—how it all works, how to manage the decreasing quality of dental insurance offered by employers, and how to maximize their level of care within the parameters of their plan. The excellent staff at Serafin Family Dentistry can help folks make the most of their benefits.
