In this blog post, I’ll be finishing up our series on the science of success. If you missed the last two parts, you can check them out [here](https://realestatecareersinutah.com/). In this final part, I’ll cover points five and six:

**5\. Remove limiting beliefs.** The truth is that limiting beliefs come from internal fear, and fear is simply false evidence appearing real. Removing limiting beliefs is a crucial step in achieving what you want. I know this is easier said than done, but we have to gain control of our fears. You often can’t control your first gut reaction, but you can control how you react and think about that reaction. When you face something you think you can’t do, I recommend you take action anyways. Trying and failing is much easier to swallow than never knowing what could have been.&nbsp;

**6\. Become accountable.** This word can make people nervous sometimes, but accountability is really just doing the things you say you’re going to do. For most of us, this is very difficult to do alone, which is why I recommend most people hire coaches. Having someone there to keep track of your actions is the best way to develop the habit of accountability; that’s why those with coaches tend to have better results than those without.&nbsp;
