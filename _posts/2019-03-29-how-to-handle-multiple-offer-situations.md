<br>Multiple-offer situations can be a challenge for buyers and a blessing for sellers, but as our market starts to shift, I’m finding that sellers are still seeking the highest and best offers. Buyers, meanwhile, are sometimes pulling back and deciding they’d rather not compete for a listing. A home that has multiple bids doesn’t always sell at or above list price, so if you’re a buyer, don’t assume you have to pay at or above list price just because you’re involved in a multiple-offer situation. Instead, figure out what the property is worth to you before making your best offer, regardless of what other buyers are doing. That way, you might find yourself getting the property you really want.
