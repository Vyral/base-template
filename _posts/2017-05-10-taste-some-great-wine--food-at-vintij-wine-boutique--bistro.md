Have you been to Vin’tij Wine Boutique & Bistro yet? We recently sat down with owner Todd Reber to give you a taste of what you’re missing in our latest local venue spotlight.

Todd got started in the restaurant industry through a series of jobs he held in college. That experience led him to decide that the marriage of food and wine seemed like a great lifestyle. He gravitated toward it because he enjoyed the camaraderie of restaurant tours and the crowds that came through. When he graduated from Florida State, he discovered he actually made more money in the restaurant industry than he could in a professional field. He decided to challenge himself and open up Vin’tij.

“It’s been a good run for the last 17 years,” Todd says.

He chose Destin as his location because Miramar Beach was close to his home and it was a big destination for outlet stores, which allowed him to use that synergy to test out his concept. 15 years ago, all of the fine wines were earmarked for restaurants. According to Todd, if you wanted a fine wine to take home and enjoy with your friends, you had very few choices. His idea was to find boutique wines and offer them at a reasonable price that you could either enjoy at the restaurant or take home with you.

In his opinion, the people make Vin’tij stand apart from the competition. He also noted Chef John and his fare, which is fresh and consistently good, and the employees that work there, who are all lifers and have helped to create a family atmosphere.

“We try to welcome everybody that walks in the door,” he says. “We know we’ve got only this moment to make it well and make it right, and that’s what we focus on. We don’t focus on what happened yesterday or what’s going to happen tomorrow—we’re in the now.”

He prefers guests’ experience to be simple. He knows they’re there to have a great meal, and their goal is to help them do so.

This is a place our team loves to go to, and it’s one of the top-rated restaurants in town. We always feel welcome there, the food is always superb, and they support the local residents. We highly recommend you try the experience for yourself.

We want to thank Todd for sitting down to talk with us. If you’d like to know more about Vin’tij, visit their website at [www.Vintij.com.](http://www.vintij.com/)
