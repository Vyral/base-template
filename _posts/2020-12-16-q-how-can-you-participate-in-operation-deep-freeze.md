<p style="text-align:center;"><em>If you want to make a difference in someone’s life this winter, now’s your chance.</em></p>

Today I’m joined by my friend Bill from the Salvation Army to talk about Operation Deep Freeze, their annual blanket drive for the homeless population of Tucson. We’ve had the pleasure of partnering with the Salvation Army for this initiative once already earlier in the year, and we were able to donate 2,500 blankets. This time around, we were able to give away 3,000.

**Operation Deep Freeze takes place every winter from November to February.** In addition to blankets, the Salvation Army’s mission is to provide food, shelter, clothing, children’s Christmas toys, and other winter necessities to those in need. Certain people’s needs have obviously grown during the pandemic, and they’ve seen record numbers of people show up to their shelter this year—no one is turned away.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in contributing to Operation Deep Freeze, **you can drop off any donatable items at the Salvation Army Hospitality House at the corner of West Speedway Boulevard and North Main Avenue.** They’re open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and they’re especially in need of blankets, hats, socks, gloves, and other winter garments.

I want to give a special thanks to Jason Rose of Nova Home Loans and Melinda Diebolt of Long Mortgage for donating blankets, hats, and mittens to this cause. If you have questions about how you can lend a helping hand, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
