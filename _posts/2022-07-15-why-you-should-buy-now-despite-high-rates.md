We like to say, “Date that rate, and marry the home.” What does that mean, and why is it especially important in our current market?

Just getting into a home is the most important step to building wealth through real estate. The market's changing, and we're already seeing more inventory and negotiable options available to buyers. When you negotiate those options, keep in mind that interest rates will shift over time. You can always refinance later, but you need to get into a house right now.

However, you could try to buy down your rate and negotiate the terms. **The market leveling out is creating more options for buyers.** You can ask the seller to buy down the rate as part of the contract and explore other options to ensure you can get into that home.

If you're looking to build wealth through real estate, now is the time to buy,&nbsp; despite the rates. If you have any questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
