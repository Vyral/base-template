<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are a few tips and tricks to consider if you’re thinking of remodeling.</em></p>

Should you remodel your home or not?

To answer that question, I’ll show you three properties in the video above that are in various stages of the remodeling process. This will give you an idea of what buyers are looking for and what you should focus on.&nbsp;

**Property No. 1 (0:30)** is in definite need of a facelift. It’s a 2-bedroom, 1-bath, 700-square-foot home in downtown Charleston. The good news is, this remodel will be relatively inexpensive. We plan on scraping the popcorn ceilings, repainting the walls with a white or light gray color, replacing the countertops with quartz surfacing, installing new appliances, and consolidating the flooring type to make the inside look bigger. This can all be done for about $10,000, and we’ll be able to increase the home’s value by about $15,000 when all is said and done.

**Property No. 2 (1:18)** highlights another useful remodeling strategy: creating a shell out of your property. As you can see, the seller for this listing, also located in downtown Charleston, decided to gut the entire home. Everything’s been ripped out down to the studs, and we’re ready for a massive renovation. After this is done, you can sell the home and let the new owner take over the renovation.&nbsp;

**Property No. 3 (1:54),** a 2-bedroom townhome on James Island, just underwent a full kitchen renovation. The best place to start remodeling is the kitchen, and in this case, we installed quartz countertops, repainted the cabinets white, and added new pulls. We also kept the white appliances because we like the light, bright look.&nbsp;

For the rest of the home, we replaced the laminate flooring in the sunroom and added luxury vinyl plank upstairs. Most importantly, we made sure the rest of the home was white just like the kitchen. There is contrast in some places, but the entire interior retains the same light, bright aesthetic. We’ve already scheduled four showings for this property, and it’s officially received an offer.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, remodeling is definitely worth it if it’s done right. If you have questions about this topic or would like to talk specifically about your home’s renovation potential, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
