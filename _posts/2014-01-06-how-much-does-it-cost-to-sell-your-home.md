When you sell your home you want as much money as possible. Sometimes we forget that to do this, there are some costs.

1. Repairs and upgrades - Buyers will always have a home inspection done. If an inspector finds something wrong or broken, the buyer may require repairs before buying.
1. Staging - This doesn't necessarily mean decorating. Staging is meant to showcase the best features of your home and sometimes that means renting a piece of furniture.
1. Vacancy insurance - If you move into your new home before you sell your current, you are required to purchase vacancy insurance which is different than just home owner's insurance.
1. Utilities - You want to keep the utilities on when showing your home.
2.
These are all some costs that people forget about. If you have any questions about selling your home, please give me a call today!
