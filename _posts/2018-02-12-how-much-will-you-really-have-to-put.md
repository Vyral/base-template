There are plenty of financing options available that allow you to put down less than 20% to buy a home.

As a buyer, how much down payment money do you really need in our market?

Many still believe they have to put down at least 20% or more, but that’s simply not the case. According to the National Association of Realtors, from October 2016 to November 2017, the average down payment amount for first-time homebuyers was just 6%. Also, 61% of first-time homebuyers put even less than 6% down. The majority of all buyers put down less than 10%.

**Here in the Wilmington market, we have some really great homes that qualify for 100% financing, USDA financing, and other forms of low or no down payment financing.** We also work with some really great lenders in the area who specialize in loan programs that require a low down payment or no down payment at all.

If you have any questions about what kind of down payment you can expect to pay in our market or you need help buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
