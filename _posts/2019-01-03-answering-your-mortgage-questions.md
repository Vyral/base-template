On today’s episode of “Facebook Live Friday!” I’ll answer a few mortgage questions homebuyers might have when closing on a home.

**After purchasing or refinancing a home, who do you pay?**

Typically, you pay your mortgage company. Before you do so, though, contact your loan officer to make sure you have the right billing instructions. Mortgage scammers are out there, and you don’t want to fall prey to them. If you get a phone call from someone telling you where to direct your payment, for instance, they might be trying to scam you. Lenders don’t ordinarily do that type of thing.

**Why do lenders sell your loan?**

Oftentimes, when lenders fund your loan, they use lines of credit and sell them on the secondary market to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in order to “keep the system circulating,” so to speak.

**How can you verify your new mortgage company is a legitimate company?**

Contact your loan officer and ask them if your loan has been sold and who it’s been sold to. Sometimes they’ll tell you this at closing, sometimes they won’t. In any case, you should receive a notification in the mail concerning this information, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

**Do mortgage companies publish your information after you close on a house?**

Not exactly, but once you close on a house, your information is recorded at the county courthouse. After that, it’s considered public information.

If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
