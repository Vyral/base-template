Right now, the situation in our market is crazy.&nbsp;

In my 17 years in the real estate business, I’ve only been a part of one boom, but **it looks like we’re entering a second boom.** The number of pending sales in February and March of this year were the highest levels we’ve seen since 2005. In other words, we’re in a very active buyer’s market.

There are a lot of people out there who want to time the market, but I advise you not to do that. Most people in our area don’t move because they want to—they move because they have to, so don’t waste your time.&nbsp;

That being said, **because we’re in such an active market, you need to start looking at homes now if you’re thinking of making a move.** Make sure you’re getting property updates on a daily basis. If a new listing pops up, you need to know about it within 15 to 20 minutes, because by the end of the day, it might already be sold.&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about what’s happening in our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
