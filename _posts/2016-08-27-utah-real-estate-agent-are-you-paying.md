By now, you have probably seen your property tax valuation. What happens if the property tax valuation is wrong?

Most of the time, clients have property tax valuations that are much lower than the appraised value or the fair market value of their home, which means you are probably paying less in property taxes than you should be. If this is the case, you probably donâ€™t want to dispute the property tax valuation.

**However, if your property tax valuation seems too high, we can help.** We will do a free home value analysis and provide the paperwork you need to dispute the valuation. Disputing your property taxes may seem like an overwhelming process, but it is actually quite simple, and we are here to guide you through it.

If you have any questions about your property tax valuation, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
