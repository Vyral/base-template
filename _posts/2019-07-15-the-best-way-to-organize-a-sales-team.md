Once you define your different sales opportunities, it’s important to understand how each role within the sales organization fits within those sales opportunities. **It’s important to have your sales team divided up into four core parts:**

1\. Inbound lead qualification<br>2\. Outbound prospector<br>3\. Closers. Generally called account executives or outside sales agents in real estate.<br>4\. Fulfillment. These include your account managers and customer service reps.

**The reasons why you want to have these roles divided are:**

1\. It takes different personality types to master these roles.<br>2\. Your productivity will be exponentially greater.<br>3\. You will have more predictable revenue and happier salespeople.<br>4\. Able to create raving fans.

**What we want to focus on here is the outbound strategy.** The outbound prospector is the person who is looking at a highly targeted list and reaching out on an outbound basis to convert those people into potential clients.&nbsp;

Once they are identified as a potential client, they become part of the inbound team. That team would then qualify the lead to make sure it’s a quality lead and can be passed on to the outbound sales person who can close the lead.&nbsp;

**People who are closers are generally terrible prospectors and great prospectors aren’t always the greatest closers.**
