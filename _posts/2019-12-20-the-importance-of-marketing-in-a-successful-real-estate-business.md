<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.</em></p>

We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but **if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.**

Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else.&nbsp;

You want to stand out from the crowd. **The best way to stand out is through your marketing.** Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.
