What is the difference between a home inspection and an appraisal? Both are crucial elements of the home buying process, but they are not the same thing at all.

First, let’s look at home inspections. When you buy a home, once the contract is ratified, you will order a home inspection. You will pay a professional inspector to go through the home and look for defective items, marginal items, and acceptable items. The inspector will give you a full report of any issues they find in the home, and you then have the opportunity to ask the seller to fix or replace certain items. The home inspection is there to protect the buyer.

Most of the time, buyers get a loan or mortgage through a bank or lender. The lender will order an appraisal in order to make sure that the loan amount lines up with the value of the property. The appraiser will find what the bank considers to be the true market value of the home so that you, the buyer, won’t overpay.

Sometimes, homes don’t appraise. For example, one of our buyers made an offer of $610,000 and the seller accepted. When the appraisal came back, however, the property was only valued at $600,000. There are a few different things that can happen:

1. The buyer can pay the $10,000 difference out of their own pocket.
2. The seller can reduce the sales price to match the appraisal price.
3. The buyer and seller can meet somewhere in the middle. This is the most common course of action.
4. If neither side can reach an agreement, you can walk away from the transaction.

You won’t lose your deposit by walking away from the transaction. The appraisal is there to protect everyone. You simply won’t close on that property.

That is the difference between a home inspection and a home appraisal. If you have any questions about the buying or selling process, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
