As agents, our success can sometimes depend on the ebb and flow of the market. We’re going through a shift in the market right now, and it may be affecting your business.

**There are two different types of shifts.** One occurs due to increased inventory; this happens when buyers are avoiding the market. It could be due to interest rate hikes, inflated home values, government policies, or an overall economic shift.

Other times, there are simply too few homes. Sellers don’t want to list, and then there are too many buyers out there without the supply to feed their demand. This usually results in inflated property values and an inability for buyers to make a purchase. New construction homes affect this as well.

If you’re struggling during this shift, I’d like to sit down with you and show you how to engineer your business so it can thrive, regardless of what the market throws at you. **Keller Williams can give you the tools and resources needed to make the most of a shift.** Gary Keller’s book “Shift” gives an in-depth look at how to handle market shifts, and it gives us an important reminder: How we structure our business is key to success.

If you’d like to talk about how to take advantage of the shift or you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
