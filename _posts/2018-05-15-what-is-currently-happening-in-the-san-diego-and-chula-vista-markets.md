What does the market look like in our area for spring 2018? **San Diego and Chula Vista are in a seller’s market.**

What does that mean, and what is the difference between a seller’s market and a buyer’s market? Basically, the difference boils down to supply and demand. We are experiencing less supply and more demand from buyers in the current market, which creates a seller’s market. Inventory of homes is down about 9%, which is due to our market having more buyers than sellers.

So how does the current inventory affect the home values in our area?

Median prices continue to grow, and they’re up about 8% from this time last year. &nbsp;But why do median prices continue to rise? This is simply because supply is low. Meanwhile, there are many buyers who want to get into this desirable area and get more bang for their buck.

On another note, let’s talk about interest rates. Interest rates continue to rise in our area. However, they are still historically low. **Now is definitely the time to break into the market if you are thinking about it.&nbsp;**

If you are a buyer, make sure you talk to a lender to get all your financing ready so you can start submitting offers. You need to know your finances and purchasing power. You then have to interview to get the right agent who can help you submit competitive offers.

If you are a seller who is still on the fence about selling, now is the time. We are still getting multiple offer situations, and you should take advantage of this situation before the rates really spike up.

If you have any questions about our current market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
