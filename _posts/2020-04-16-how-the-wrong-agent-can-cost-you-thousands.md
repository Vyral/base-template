Here’s why selecting experienced, knowledgeable representation is invaluable.

We’re working with a group right now that needs to relocate, and as we looked up their property to begin the selling process, it was evident that **these folks paid $260,000 back in 2017 for a home that was only worth around $238,000 to $242,000 back then.**&nbsp;

I don’t know how it appraised, but I know now that we cannot sell it; the market has increased 2% to 3% every single year since 2017.&nbsp;

In another recent scenario, an individual had listed a property (their first ever time selling) for $160,000, and guess who put an offer in? Yours truly. It was worth every bit of $180,000. **We put an expiration date, nailed it down within an hour, and walked into a lot of money in equity because someone underpriced the home.&nbsp;**

So if you’re in the market looking to buy or sell a home, I can’t overstate the importance of hiring someone who has tons of experience, sold a lot of houses, knows the market inside and out, and will ensure your $700,000 purchase is good not just now, but well into the future.&nbsp;
