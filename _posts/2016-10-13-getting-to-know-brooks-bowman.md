Today, we wanted you to get to know a little bit about Brooks Bowman.

**How did you hear about Team Lally?**
I first heard about Team Lally when I was in a brokerage of my own about six or seven years ago. I watched Adrienne and Attilio thrive during the market collapse of 2008 and 2009 when quite a few of us were being taken down. During that time, they built a great business, so I was very impressed.

**What motivated you to join Team Lally?**
I was motivated to join Team Lally because of their success. They have a great track record and they’re extremely successful in the marketplace. As I was wondering about the future of my own brokerage, I would see their signs all over my own neighborhood and the surrounding areas.

**What’s your role on the team?**
My role on the team is as a Listing Partner. That means I work with owners and sellers but not with buyers.

**What do you enjoy most about working on a team?**
I enjoy working on a team because of the efficiency it produces and the camaraderie it provides. Each transaction is dealt with in such a way that so much gets done in such an efficient manner. Additionally, the team ends up becoming your friends and family. I have many friends here on Team Lally, and I enjoy that. Experiencing the negotiation of transactions with our chief negotiator Howard Net has been phenomenal. All of the other agents and our administrative staff have been great to work with as well.

 If you have any questions for Brooks or need help buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
