Is winter a good time to put your home on the market? **It's actually the second best time to sell a home**, just behind springtime. Why?

There is less inventory on the market for buyers to choose from, and those buyers out looking in the winter are great buyers. These buyers are moving for a reason; they're not the semi-serious tire kickers that you see looking at houses in the spring and summer.

Interest rates went up a little bit after the election, but they are still very low. These **low rates have been the tipping point for some buyers who have been on the fence.**

If you have any questions about selling during the winter or you're thinking about buying or selling a house, give me a call or send me an email soon. I'd be happy to help in any way I can!
