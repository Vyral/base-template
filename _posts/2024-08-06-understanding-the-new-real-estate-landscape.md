The Twin Cities real estate market is going through some changes. Today, we are going to discuss some market updates and the latest developments in the NAR lawsuit, which will take effect in mid-August. Generally, even though there are fewer new listings and slower sales in June 2024 compared to June 2023, home prices are relatively stable, showing a balanced market. With regards to NAR settlement policy changes, restrictions on advertising buyers agent commissions and a mandatory written agreement between buyers and buyer’s agents will take effect on August 17.
