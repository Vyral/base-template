<p style="text-align: center;"><em>People often ask whether we host open houses and, if so, why. We’ll answer this question today.</em></p>

Sellers often ask me whether or not my team and I utilize open houses to market listings.&nbsp;

Sometimes we do, but this isn’t always the case. When I’m asked this question, I like to make it very clear why we might choose to hold an open house, as well as the fact that an open house and a broker’s open are not one and the same.&nbsp;

**Open houses are events during which you invite the public to come view your home during a set period of time.** A broker’s open, meanwhile, is an event when other brokers or agents are invited to come tour the home. These are often done in gated communities or in particularly unusual or high-end homes.&nbsp;

But, back on the subject of open houses, our team likes to make clients aware that it’s possible to show a house without hosting an open house. One way of achieving this is by creating a listing video or a virtual 3-D tour.

Frankly, **open houses are also quite beneficial to agents, as they bring in prospective clients.** This doesn’t mean they don’t benefit sellers, though.&nbsp;

One of the main reasons we continue to hold open houses is that sometimes, buyers want to look at and explore the property without their Realtor following along. Of course, buyers have to show up for an open house to be effective, which is why our team puts up plenty of signs to lead buyers to the property prior to the day of the event.&nbsp;

As with everything we do in our business, the way we conduct our open houses is designed to help sellers maximize their results.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
