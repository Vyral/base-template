What is the best way to buy and sell a house simultaneously? Today I’ll discuss some of the options you have if you’re looking to list your home and purchase another all at once.

The ideal way is to put your current house on the market and **start the sales process at the same time that you’re getting approved for a home purchase**. That way, while you’re negotiating your sale, you can also be in the market searching for homes and doing your due diligence. The goal is to align the timeline of both transactions so that they close on the same day, making for a seamless transition between homes.

The next option is to **list your home for sale and move into temporary housing** while you search for another home to buy. That could involve moving in with friends or family or even staying in a month-to-month rental. This option allows you to collect the proceeds from your home sale and focus solely on finding your next home. Keep in mind, however, that this method only works if you can secure temporary housing with relative ease; not everyone’s circumstances are flexible enough to make this feasible.

Alternatively, you could **sell your current house with the caveat that the buyer signs a rent-back agreement with you**. Essentially, that agreement would allow you to live in that house for a preset period after you sell it. In a hot seller’s market like this, some buyers may even be willing to let you stay there for little or no charge while you use that rent-back period to search for a home.

Hopefully this gave you a clearer understanding of how to buy and sell at the same time. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to give us a call or send an email. We’d love to help you.
