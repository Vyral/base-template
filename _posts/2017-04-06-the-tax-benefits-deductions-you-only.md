Tax season is here, so today we've got a quick guide on how to reduce your taxable income if you're a homeowner.

It's that time of year againâ€”tax time.

**One of the biggest advantages of being a homeowner is that you can use part of what you pay for your home to reduce your taxable income.** This holds true for first-time homebuyers or anyone who owns a home.

If you bought a home in 2016, there's a one-time deduction you can take for the costs incurred when buying the house. This includes closing costs, banking fees, and interim interest to name a few. There are also ongoing deductions you can deduct year after year as long as you own the house. These include mortgage interest and property taxes.

These deductions can combine with your other deductions to decrease your overall tax burden. In fact, **a recent client of ours saved $2,400 a year in taxes by being a homeowner that he wouldn't have been able to take advantage of as a renter.**

If you're thinking about buying a home, we would love to help you reap all the benefits of home ownership. Just give us a call or send us an email and we can discuss your unique situation.
