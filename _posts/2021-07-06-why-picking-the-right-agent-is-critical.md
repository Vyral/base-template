Real estate is done a bit differently per company and per agent, so it’s crucial to choose the right real estate agent when you decide to buy or sell a house. When picking an agent, consider how they communicate, how they run their business, their business hours, and the kind of technology they’re using. Also, **think about whether your personalities work together,** and ensure they’re trustworthy and transparent. There are many small pieces to a real estate transaction that consumers don’t know about, so you need the agent that’s best for you, especially in a hot market like the one we’re in right now.

Our current real estate market is like a roller coaster; it’s moving quickly and taking fast turns. Having someone to guide you, tell you what to prepare for, and communicate the way you want to be communicated with will dictate the experience you have throughout the transaction.&nbsp;

Hiring a great agent is one of the most important things you can do, and **hiring an agent on a team is best.** In any situation, a team is always better than one all-star who tries to do it all. A team of excellent agents all working toward a common goal will beat a solo agent because they’ll be spread too thin. We pride ourselves on our fantastic team of agents, marketers, coaches, and staff; we do everything we can to make your experience as great as possible.
