Every spring, we receive a publication from the Montana Association of Realtors that breaks down all the different associations in the state by their MLS and compares their last year of activity to the previous year. I always find this report interesting; Montana is a big state with a lot of different economies and business opportunities. The most recent report has been released, and today I wanted to walk you through what we learned about the sales activity of the various Montana associations so that you have a better understanding of what’s going on in our statewide real estate market.
