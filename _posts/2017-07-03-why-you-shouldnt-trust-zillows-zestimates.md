{% include youtube.html %}I’m sure you’ve all heard of Zillow: the most popular real estate search engine in the world. They have over 73 million visitors each month who are looking to buy, sell, and search for homes. Many of those visitors also utilize their online tools, such as their Zestimate feature. **It’s essentially an automatic home valuation, but you should take its results with a grain of salt.
<br>**
<br>The problem with Zestimates is that the data they take into consideration is often inaccurate and/or outdated. This can lead to a lot of tension between buyers and sellers. Zestimates have a national median error rate of 5%, which balloons to 12% in the Tampa market alone. 12% of a million dollar property is over $100,000! That’s a lot of money to leave on the table due to an inaccurate estimate. Take Zillow’s own CEO for example. **He recently sold his Seattle home for 40% less than what the Zestimate said it was worth.
<br>**{% include pullquote.html %}
<br>Zillow is also currently facing a lawsuit from a woman in Illinois who is claiming that her Zestimate repeatedly undervalued her house and created a roadblock in its sale.
<br>
<br>In response, Zillow is offering a million dollars to whoever can improve the accuracy of their algorithm. Until that day comes, I would advise against using Zestimates as anything other than a starting point. **To get the most accurate value possible for your home, you should contact a real estate professional.**I’d be glad to help you get to the bottom of your home’s value myself.
