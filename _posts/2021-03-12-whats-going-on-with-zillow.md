<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what you should know about what’s going on with Zillow right now.</em></p>

If you’re interested in real estate, you probably visit Zillow often. A few years ago, their information was not accurate; they would display listings that had already sold, and they had a hard time getting their data feed to work in general. However, over the past couple of months, they’ve been a pretty accurate real estate website because they’ve made some changes.

Before, Zillow had contracts with brokers and agents to promote their listings above others. Now they’re going about it a different way. **This has resulted in some information being lost during the transition.** They’ve lost some sales and reviews, but hopefully, they’ll get it fixed soon.

If you’re a real estate buyer or seller in this market, you should know that you can’t afford to miss out on a house because Zillow didn’t feed it through. It happened with a client of ours a few weeks ago, and they were devastated.

**While Zillow is still a great tool, you can’t only trust Zillow to find the houses you’re looking for.** You need to be looking in other places or contact a professional agent who has access to all the homes that are on the market right now. You can check out our site that’s directly fed from the MLS by clicking the link above.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
