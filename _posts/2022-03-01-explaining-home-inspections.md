Today Iâ€™ll explain what a home inspection is. When you hire a professional inspector, they conduct a thorough review of the house's most important components, such as the structure, the roof, HVAC, and the electrical system. This process usually takes at least a few hours.

A home inspection takes place after the seller accepts an offer to buy the house. You want to get the inspection done before the option period ends. That's why it's important to immediately schedule an inspection after the purchase agreement has been signed and executed. Home inspection costs range between $300 and $500, depending on the square footage of the home. **The inspector will provide you with valuable information that could affect your decision whether or not to buy the property.** That information can save you a lot of money.

If you have any questions about home inspections, feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
