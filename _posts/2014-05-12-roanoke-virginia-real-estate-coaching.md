Avoid Becoming Overwhelmed this Selling Season

As real estate agents, we tend to be reactive instead of being proactive. It isn’t until we are buried in leads that we decide to purchase a lead management system. **As the market begins to heat up, I encourage you to get your software platforms in place and find out what contact management system you will plan to use.**

This allows you to track your leads – **the last thing you want is business, which you pay for, coming in with no way to manage it!** Hiring help during this influx of business is also a great move. Your first hire should be an **administrative assistant** – this person will help you bring in the leads, qualify them and find the good from the bad. However if you are unable to pay for additional employees, stop paying for leads. You don’t want to gain the reputation of someone who can’t handle the public’s inquiries.

If you have any questions about team dynamics or lead management, feel free to call or email me. Thanks and have a great day!
