Buying your first home can be a very exciting time. It can also be overwhelming, so here are a few things that you should know.

First of all, it’s important to pick a great agent. Working with an agent does not cost the buyer anything; the seller pays both the buyer’s agent and the listing agent. Your agent will listen to your needs and what’s important to you in a home.

Your agent will also help you develop a long-term plan. Maybe you plan on staying in the area for awhile, or maybe you’re waiting on a promotion that would require you to move in a few years. Either way, they will show you homes that match your needs and your long-term plan.

You should also make sure that your agent is good at negotiating. That way, when you do make an offer on a home, you won’t get stuck paying the listing price. When the inspection comes back, your agent will need to negotiate with the seller on repairs as well.

Once you have the perfect agent lined up, go and find a great lender. Local lenders are best because they know about local down payment assistance programs. Sometimes cities have certain programs that they can get you enrolled in and save you some money.

Local lenders are also a little more reasonable when it comes to closing costs. Online lenders will sometimes trump up closing costs to get you a low interest rate, which will cost you more than working with a local lender.

Now, it’s time to shop! Look at different neighborhoods and consider how far they are from area schools, what your commute to work would be, and the traffic. Are you too close to the freeway? Too far?

You should also drive around the neighborhood you are interested in at different times of the day. Go on the weekends, in the evenings, and during the day. What’s the neighborhood like? Do you feel safe there? Does it have the amenities you want, such as areas to ride your bike or walk your dog?

Finally, when it comes time to make an offer, we’ll look at the comparable properties for the area to determine whether the listing price is a good one for this market. In other words, we’ll let you know if the listing price is too high or too low. In this market, low inventory sometimes causes sellers to list below market value in order to attract a lot of attention to their home. We’ll make sure that you get a good deal on the house and that it’s at a fair market value.
