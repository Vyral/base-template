Today, I want to introduce you to Valley Custom Homes, a true custom home builder I represent here in the valley. They build only four to five custom homes a year because, as a true custom home builder, they take the time to ensure the house is built right.

**Valley Custom Homes build the home how you want it, with the features and amenities you want from your house.** This is something that not every home builder will do. I can say that they build some of the most beautiful homes in the valley. How do I know? Because they built my home here about a year ago.

You’ll see in the video above how gorgeous some of the features and amenities are. From the spacious and luxurious kitchen to the expansive great room to the beautiful craftsmanship throughout the home, **you can see the quality of Valley Custom Homes’ work on display.**

If you are interested in learning more about the true custom homes offered by Valley Custom Homes, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. Remember, I am here to be your resource for all of your real estate needs, be they buying, selling, investing, or just having questions about the market.
