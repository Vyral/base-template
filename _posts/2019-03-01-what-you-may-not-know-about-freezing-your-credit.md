What is freezing your credit all about?&nbsp;

It’s a tool that restricts people and companies from accessing your credit report without your specific permission.

It is not the same as a fraud alert. **It does not affect your credit score. You can still request your free credit report once a year.&nbsp;**

And you can temporarily remove the credit freeze.&nbsp; Or, you can permanently remove the credit freeze.&nbsp; And it does not cost you anything to do so. It can be done within minutes of your requesting an “unfreeze” (but double check the time frame with each bureau).&nbsp;

The bottom line, it makes it harder for identity thieves to steal your credit and personal information or open new credit in your name.&nbsp;

I have listed below the three main credit bureaus to call or go online to learn about it further.&nbsp;

**Here’s what they will need from you:**

* Name
* Date of birth
* Social security number
* Your address

**Other than creditors, here are some other reasons you may need to unfreeze your credit report access:**

* Applying for a new job
* New credit card
* New credit requests you have initiated
* Utility or cell phone companies.

Once a credit freeze is in place, it secures your credit file so nobody can access it unless you give direct authorization to the credit bureaus, usually through a password-protected credit bureau website or PIN.
