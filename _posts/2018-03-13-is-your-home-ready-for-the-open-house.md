Open houses are a great way to get exposure for your home and allow people to come in and see themselves in your home. What are some things you can do to prepare for the open house and help sell your home?&nbsp;

**First of all, declutter.** Make sure that the house is clean and that all knicknacks are put away. In a sense, you’ll want to sterilize the home; take down all personal pictures to allow the buyer to visualize themselves and their stuff inside the home.&nbsp;

If you have pets, you will want to take them to Petsmart or the dog park during open houses. They should be out of the way during the open house.&nbsp;

**As the seller, you should also be out of the way.** Go somewhere else during the open house. Believe it or not, a casual conversation with a prospective buyer can kill your ability to negotiate down the line. You might mention your motivation for selling the home. You might say, “We’re really excited, but we have to be out of here in 30 days. We’d do anything to get rid of this home.” That will not do you any favors when it comes time to negotiate a price for your home.&nbsp;

Finally, make sure that you take care of your lawn. Pull weeds, make sure your flower beds look nice, and cut the grass. Get all of the toys out of the driveway and make sure everything looks nice and pristine. **If your home has great curb appeal, more buyers will want to come in and check out the open house.**&nbsp;

If you follow these tips, you will be all set for a successful open house.
