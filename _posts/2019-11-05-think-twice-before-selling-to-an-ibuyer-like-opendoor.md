As a home seller, selling to an iBuyer like Opendoor might seem like a good idea, but you should think twice before doing so.&nbsp;

Opendoor states that they’ll give you a cash offer and a quick, convenient closing, and they also claim that they may be able to give you an offer that’s above market value. However, **data compiled by Collateral Analytics and the NAR doesn’t support this claim.&nbsp;**

You see, convenience comes at a cost. Right now in Tucson, we have a record-low amount of inventory, and most homes listed under $300,000 attract multiple offers—some even sell for over asking price. You won’t get any of that if you work with Opendoor.

So, my advice to you is **slow the process down, crunch the numbers, and do your own analytics so you know for sure the cost of convenience.** It could be pretty substantial. If you need help figuring out which home selling route to take, give us a call and we’ll compare our home selling program to Opendoor’s. We can also give you a detailed market report.&nbsp;
