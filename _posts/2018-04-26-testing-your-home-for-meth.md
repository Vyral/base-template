Today we’re going to talk about meth.

This drug is a major epidemic in terms of public health, but it also is an issue in the real estate community. I run into it all the time, so I wanted to put the message out about how important **it is to test every home for the drug.** Meth does not pick a price point or a neighborhood—it’s everywhere.

**Testing for meth is relatively inexpensive,** and I recommend it to everybody when they’re buying a home. Home inspectors can perform the test or you can get the kit from a lab and do it yourself. Regardless of how you do it, it’s important to get that knowledge.

I work with state-certified decontamination specialists to whom I refer my clients when they have questions. They’re able to dispel the myths about homes exposed to meth production, like the one that suggests that such homes are uninhabitable and must be torn down. That’s not true—those homes can be cleaned, decontaminated, and sold with no problem.

**The bottom line is to get the facts and take care of the problem correctly.**

If you have any questions about this issue as it relates to real estate, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
