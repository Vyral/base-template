<div style="text-align: left;">Today Im joined by Oscar Urrutia, the vice president of the Valley Relics Museum. Today were going to talk about their new website.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">[The Valley Relics Museum](https://valleyrelicsmuseum.org/) began over 30 years ago when Tommy Gelinas, the founder and curator of the museum, began collecting artifacts from iconic places in the Valley area. As places began to close down, he went out and grabbed these artifacts himself so that they could be enjoyed by generations to come. This museum is open to the public every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. with free admission. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The museums new website, [MyValleyPass.com](http://myvalleypass.com/), was created to bring you **a curated list of all the arts and entertainment events happening in the San Fernando Valley.** The website now has some of those events posted, so be sure to check it out to plan your weeks ahead.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Whats so great about this website is that it puts all the events on one page so that you dont miss ones you wouldnt have known about because you live in a different part of the Valley. <div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">The Valley Relics Museum is open to the public every Saturday. <div style="text-align: left;">The Valley Relics Museum also has their own events planned in the coming weeks, including the San Fernando Valley Summer Drive-In Nights, where they will be showing locally-filmed movies including "E.T." and "The Karate Kid." Youll be able to listen to the movie through your car stereo when you drive up, and there will be a live band performance before each movieso be sure to show up early.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The museum has also set up a new historical film bus tour that will be starting in September, where participants will be taken to historic film locations around the San Fernando Valley. There will be two tours available for you to choose from, so look out for news of those tickets going on sale as well.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">If you have any other questions about [MyValleyPass.com](http://myvalleypass.com/), you can contact Oscar at 818-678-4934 or through their website.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">If you have any questions for me or youre looking to buy or sell a home in the area, give me a call. Id be happy to help.<div style="text-align: left;"> style="text-align: left;">
