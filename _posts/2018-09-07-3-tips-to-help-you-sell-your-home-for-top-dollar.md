&nbsp;

If you want to sell your home for top dollar, here are three tips that will help you do so.

First, **make sure your home has great curb appeal** so it gives potential buyers a good first impression. The whole exterior needs to be inviting when buyers pull up, so make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.

<br>Second, **give your house a deep clean**. Clear the cobwebs out of the corners, open the blinds, clean the baseboards and the carpets, etc. There’s nothing more inviting than stepping into a home that’s clean and fresh-smelling.

Lastly, **declutter the home and remove any personal items** so buyers can feel like the home is theirs. Buyers want to see the home—not your stuff. The better the opportunity you can give them to do this, the better the opportunity you give yourself to sell for top dollar.
