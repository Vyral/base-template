I have a quick update for you on the Charlotte real estate market as we head toward the end of summer. We’ll take a closer look at the latest numbers, inventory levels, and what’s going on with monthly mortgage payments as prices increase.

In the chart at 0:19 in the video above, we didn’t quite see the 40% increase in inventory that we usually see between March and April. We did see a spike in May, which are the most recent inventory numbers to come out. **That’s good news for buyers because more inventory means less competition for you.**

The average mortgage rate right now is 3.17%. By the end of the second quarter of 2022, we may see an average of 3.57% according to industry experts, which will still be a great number to lock in if you’re in the market to buy.

As far as monthly payments are concerned, homebuyers were paying an average of $1,184 per month on their mortgage payments in May. This figure is slightly up from right around $1,000 in May 2020. If we wind the clock back to 2008, that average payment was closer to $1,500. **We’re still well over $300 below the average payment from that time.**

This is still a crazy-hot market if you’re looking to sell. There is also more inventory coming your way if you’re a buyer.

If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
