This week’s question comes from Alice, who asked “How do we select the professionals who are going to help us make owning a home a reality? What do we look for, and how do we know if we found the right agent and lender?”<br><br>**The most important characteristics you should look for in an agent are whether they’re competent and willing to take the time to really educate you** on the choices that are available to you and your ability to buy in today’s market.

As Dave Ramsey, the financial guru, advises: When getting help with money—whether it’s insurance, real estate, or investing—you should always look for someone with the heart of a teacher, not the heart of a salesman. All of the professionals we recommend in Memphis are experienced, vetted, and endorsed local providers (ELPs).

**You want some to invest in your family’s future with you, someone who isn’t focused on the transactions but is instead focused on helping you understand the process while helping you find your dream home.**

Diane and I have been Dave’s Memphis ELPs for almost five years now, and his introductions represent about 12% of our annual business.

If you have any questions or want our help, give us a call or email us. We’d be happy to be your ELP.
