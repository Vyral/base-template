Today I’d like to share three best ways to obtain top dollar for your listing in this hot market. Let’s start the countdown.

**3. Build value.** The best way to do this is by making simple, but effective, improvements that will bring you a high return on investment. Adding new siding, if it’s needed, is a prime example of the kind of project you’ll want to take on. Overall, it’s better to make necessary updates and repairs before ever putting your home on the market. This will avoid certain issues from coming up in inspection reports later on in the transaction and will ensure you earn top dollar for your home.&nbsp;

**2. Remove clutter.** Any unnecessary items that are sitting out run the risk of making your home appear untidy. Put away anything that distracts from your home’s potential. Doing so can not only make your home look better, but it can also help give you a head start on packing.&nbsp;

**1. Price your home correctly.** Overpricing your home will only cause your property to sit on the market for longer than need be. When, or if, it eventually does sell, you’ll earn a much lower figure than what you would have achieved from pricing it properly from the start.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
