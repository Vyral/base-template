If the question of whether to sell now or wait until spring is something you’ve been turning over in your mind, allow me to answer: You want to sell now, and here are six reasons why this is the case.

**1. There’s less competition now.** The bulk of sellers are going to hold off until spring to list their home, giving you a decisive advantage if you sell ahead of these “fairweather sellers.” And let’s face it: No one wants to see a bunch of “For Sale” signs on your street all at once. Selling now means your home won’t get lost in the shuffle of the spring selling frenzy.

**2. Winter buyers are serious buyers.** For some buyers, life circumstances like changing jobs, getting married or divorced, having children, or downsizing dictate that they need to find a home immediately. Those looking to buy in the fall and winter months aren’t just out for leisure or to enjoy the weather—they mean business and are ready to buy. &nbsp;

**3. You’ll get a great agent.** The typical agent will advise you to wait until spring to sell your home. It’s often the path to least resistance in the market: It’s the traditional time to sell, the easiest time to list, there’s great weather, etc. However, the savvy, highly skilled agent will have what it takes to get your home sold in the colder months. They’re the ones that will do a lot more than plug your information into the MLS and wait for the phone to ring.

**4. You’re able to stage seasonally.** When staging your home, you can go with the holiday seasonal theme by decorating with lights, candles, and other decorative items that go with this festive time of year. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**5. Mortgage rates are still low right now.** As it stands now, mortgage rates remain low, but will the same be true in the spring? Well, it’s the devil we know versus the devil we don’t know. When government regulation spills over into the housing market, we know that rates are inclined to trend upward. Why not do yourself a favor and take action now before buyers are impacted by a rate increase?

**6. Transactions are more efficient in the winter.** As a result of less activity, transactions move quickly, are more efficient, and more likely to stay on time. In the warmer months, appraisers are sometimes backlogged by the heavy volume of homes they’re dealing with, which, in turn, delays the closing cycle. This is where being a bit “off-season” can work to your advantage: Processes are much more streamlined and move with fewer delays and hiccups.
