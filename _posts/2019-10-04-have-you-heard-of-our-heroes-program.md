In 2014, Jeff Grossarth and I introduce the “Homes for Heroes” program to Connecticut. Since then, we’ve helped dozens of families save thousands when buying or selling a home. This program is specially made for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, military members, healthcare professionals, and teachers. To find out how you can benefit from this program, watch this short video.
