*We’re hosting a downsizing seminar and you’re invited\!*

We’re soon hosting a downsizing seminar for sellers. If you’re considering moving to a smaller space, whether that’s downsizing, to a retirement community, even out of state, we have the information you’ll need. **The seminar will be at Maryland Golf and Country Club at 1335 East Macphail Road, Bel Air, MD 21015.** We will provide dinner and drinks.&nbsp;

A financial adviser will be there to help answer any questions you may have, including about estate planning. An attorney will be present to answer any legal questions. We will also have agents, an accountant, a lender, and a stager there to help you with anything you need in this process. There is no obligation—you do not have to do any business with us, we simply want to help you.&nbsp;

We have limited space, so this seminar is reserved for the first 30 couples that sign up. Call or email us to register. If you reserve a place, please show up, as there are many who would want your seats. If you need to cancel, please let us know immediately.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this event or real estate in general, feel free to contact us. We would love to help you.
