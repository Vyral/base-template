Meet Benjy Gilholm, one of our great agents here at Team Lally.

When Benjy first heard about our team, he was working at another top real estate team here in Honolulu. During that time, **he noticed his team was referring all of their short sales over to agents on our team.**

Benjy took note of our good reputation and decided to make the switch. What ultimately motivated his move to our team was that he didn’t want to be a solo agent anymore. Being part of a team where you have a specific duty is something he was definitely attracted to.

**Team Lally has a “great team environment that is based around continuing education,”** says Benjy.

As a listing partner for our team, Benjy specializes in getting listing agreements signed and properties sold.

The thing he most enjoys about working with Team Lally is our atmosphere. According to him, “We create great experiences.”

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
