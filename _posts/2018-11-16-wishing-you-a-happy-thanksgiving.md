During this time of year, we think about how much we have to be grateful for. Thanksgiving is a time to give, a time to love, and a time to reflect on things that mean the most in our lives. This Thanksgiving, we are especially cherishing the weeks, hours, and minutes that weâ€™re able to spend on the beautiful island of Kauai. To all of our family, friends, neighbors, clients, and co-workers: We wish you a truly beautiful and bountiful Thanksgiving.&nbsp;
