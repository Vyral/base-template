Today I’m coming to you from Little Bluebird, located in the Old Main Street Station at the corner of 1967 and Main street in downtown Buda.

This is one of the busiest intersections in our historic Buda, and there’s a great business opportunity here to be had. If you’re a local entrepreneur and you’re dying to be a small business owner, **this is a great occasion for you.**

I’m here with one of the owners of Little Bluebird, Margaret Goebler, There are some great items here such as clothing, jewelry, artwork, and all sorts of neat finds. If you haven’t been, I highly recommend you check it out.

**Floor space has become available on the premises. You, as a business owner, can come in and sell your items here.** They’re looking for one (possibly up to four) vendors to take this space. They’re looking for vendors who sell items such as antiques, artwork, herbal teas, flavored oils, and anything else that would fit the theme. The sky’s the limit.

If you have a successful online business and want to bring it into a physical space, this is a great chance for you to get that started.

I hope you can check it out, and **please spread the word.** We love to let everyone know about this opportunity.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We’ll help however we can.
