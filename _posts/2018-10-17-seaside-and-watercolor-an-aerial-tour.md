Seaside and Watercolor is a gorgeous area. It’s so beautiful, in fact, that it’s been used in a number of films, like The Truman Show. These master-planned communities have a multitude of amenities and fun activities to be enjoyed by the whole family. The location takes on a perfect coastal village charm, with an infrastructure based on short travel distances and a skyline free from distracting high-rise buildings.  See what life is like in Seaside and Watercolor by watching this short video.
