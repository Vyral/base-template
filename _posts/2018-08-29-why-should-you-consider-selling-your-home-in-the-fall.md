There are four great reasons to sell your home in the fall:

**1. Buyers are more serious.** During the spring and summer, many buyers are more curious than actually committed to purchasing a property. On the other hand, buyers in the fall tend to be more serious. Many have been searching throughout the summer and have not found their perfect home yet. Others are simply forced to look for a new home because of a new job, a work relocation, or because they want to complete their move ahead of the holidays. In other words, fall buyers make up in dedication for what they might lack in numbers.&nbsp;

**2. There's less competition.** Homes that are not sold by the end of the summer are often delisted. Otherwise, they start to draw less interest because of the time they have spent on the market. If you list in the fall, you have the benefit of standing out, as well as facing less competition than during the "hotter" seasons.

**3. Perfect time for curb appeal.** The leaves are changing colors, the grass is still green, and your home looks its best. If you wait until the winter, the grass and trees might die, reducing your curb appeal.

**4. It’s easier to buy and sell at the same time.** A lot of times, sellers are also buyers. If you sell in the fall, it’s also a great time to get a good deal on your next purchase. There are a lot of listings left over from the summer, and those sellers are a bit more desperate for an offer. If we market your house properly and get it sold in a timely fashion, you can get out there and make an offer on a great house and get a good deal.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about why the fall is such an opportune time for you to sell or about the home selling process in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
