Life events can have a major impact on what you need from your home. Retirement is one of the biggest changes many homeowners face. Is it time for you to downsize to a smaller home?

According to the National Association of Realtors, the top three reasons people over the age of 55 choose to move are because they want a smaller house, they want to be closer to loved ones, or because they are retired.

If you're in this group, changing priorities may be top of mind for you. **As your lifestyle changes, what you need in your home likely changes too.** Moving into a small home can open up your schedule. When you downsize, you can spend less time maintaining your home and more time with the people you love. It can lead to less stress and increased happiness.

**You may have more equity than you realize** because of the record level of home price appreciation over the past year. Those equity gains could allow you to make a large down payment on your next home. Putting more money down means a smaller monthly mortgage payment and greater financial freedom. It can also help you stand out significantly in today's competitive housing market.

If you've recently retired or are planning to soon, your needs are likely changing, which means that now may be the perfect time to downsize. Let's connect and find a home that matches your solution. Reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
