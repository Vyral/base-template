I recently joined my friend Sean to talk about the Clarksville market and answer some common questions that I’ve been getting from friends and clients. **Here’s an outline of the great discussion we had, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the question(s) that interest you most:**

0:28- What are the hottest homes in the Clarksville market and what’s driving the demand for these kinds of homes?

1:30- The types of homes that aren’t selling as quickly and why.

2:45- The median price in the Clarksville market and how it compares to what we’ve seen in years past.

4:00- Where you should start if you’re looking to break into the Clarksville market as a homebuyer.

4:50- If you’re looking to get an accurate valuation for what your home is worth, here’s where you should go.

**Thanks again to Sean for asking some great questions.** If you have any other questions for me in the meantime or need any assistance with buying or selling a home in the Clarksville area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
