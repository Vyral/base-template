<center><em>With a team, you can pass the baton to win in a transaction.</em></center>

<br>Have you ever run track or seen a relay race? If so, then you know the necessity of passing the baton from one team member to another. A good track coach will tell you that **a relay is won or lost in the transfer of the baton**.

We at The Wolek Group believe in the importance of passing the baton in real estate too. If you don’t have a team, you have no one to pass the baton to and must do all the work yourself. We pass three different batons during our real estate transactions.

First, when working with a seller, we pass a baton from the listing agent to the listing manager. The second baton is passed from the buyer agent to the transaction coordinator during pending, or from the listing manager to the transaction coordinator when working with a seller. Third, **between 24 and 48 hours before closing is when the baton is passed back to the real estate agent** from the transaction coordinator. This arms the agent with all the information they need to know before closing.

When passing all these batons, what truly matters is communication between team members. Every time a baton is passed, it’s followed by a debriefing, a conversation between team members to ensure we completely understand all the intricacies and needs of the client. Anytime the ball is dropped it goes back to a lack of communication. We do our best to not allow that to happen; **it’s our goal to win the relay\!** We win by getting to closing with elated clients.

If you want to learn more about how we pass the batons, I’m sharing the information in my closed Facebook group Your Journey With Jennie. Join today\! If you ever have any questions about real estate, reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
