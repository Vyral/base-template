Our referral partners are essential and help us move transactions along quickly and smoothly. Here are those people who we want our clients to work with.

In the real estate business, we like to have trusted contacts and resources that we can refer to our clients when they need help. Here is a rundown of the professionals that we refer our clients to.

**One of the most common referrals we give is our mortgage broker.** They work strictly for you and don’t get paid until your mortgage is qualified. They are looking at specifically what fits your needs as a buyer and we have a good group of people that we trust implicitly.

Another group that you’ll need to work with as a homebuyer or seller is a lawyer or a notary who can register the property. We usually recommend a notary because they’re more common and they’re a little less expensive.

**Property inspectors are another group that we refer our clients to.** We want you to have a quality inspector so that you have someone who can find out the pros, cons, and any deficiencies in a home. A good inspector will ensure that you buy a great property.

Finally, we consider ourselves as a referral partner. Our job is to provide excellent service to you in the Lower Mainland. **We don’t spend a lot of our income on marketing ourselves**; we prefer to use it on marketing our properties and helping our buyers and sellers get their deals done expediently.

If you have any other questions for us or need a referral for any of the above services, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
