Today we have a message for all the homebuyers out there who also need to sell. You may find yourself in a tough position when writing offers that are subject to you selling your home. If you’ve made a contingent offer like this, you’ve probably found yourself on the short end of the stick. **A bridge loan is a unique solution that can help you get your home without having to make a contingent offer.**
