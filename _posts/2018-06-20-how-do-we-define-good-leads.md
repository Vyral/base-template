One of the questions I get all the time is, “What is your definition of a lead?” Obviously, we spend several hours per day calling cold traffic, but we don’t want to give our clients cold leads. **We want to give them warm leads, so here’s what defines a good lead for us:**

**1. They have to say that they want to talk to you.**

**2. They have to talk about the value of their home.** Whether they’re curious about what it is or they think they know what it is.

**3. They have to talk about the condition of their home.** We want to know what kind of condition the property is in.

**4. They need to specify their time frame.** What’s their motivation? When do they want to move?&nbsp;

**5. They must provide their best contact information.** If they aren’t ready to do business right away, we can still drop them into a nurture campaign if we have their contact information.

**6. They must confirm their address.** We want to make sure that they are who they say they are and that they are the decision maker in the home.

**7. They must expect to be contacted.** We will confirm the best times to call them and pass that lead on to our client.

In doing these things, we feel that we’re passing better leads to our clients than most other sources are. These people aren’t making up contact information or just trying to get us off the phone, they’re telling us that they want to speak with us and that they are interested in buying or selling a home.&nbsp;

That’s how we define a lead and this has been working well for many of our clients. If you have any questions for us or you’re interested in talking to us about helping you scale your outbound prospecting, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
