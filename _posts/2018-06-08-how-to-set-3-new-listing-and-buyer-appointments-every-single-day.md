How do you set three new listing appointments and three new buyer appointments every single week?

On our team, we believe in the fundamentals. We’re running a sales business, so we set standards for both listing and buying agents. Listing agents must set a minimum of three new listing appointments each week. Meanwhile, buyer agents must set two new buyer appointments each week their first week and three each week in their second year. 

How do we do it? It’s not that complicated, but it does take a good bit of hard work. 

What I’ve come to learn is that salespeople need to be in front of a lot of new people every day. That’s been a fundamental principle of sales for thousands of years—whether it’s selling Persian rugs 2,000 years ago or vacuum cleaners 15 years ago. **In order to have a robust sales business, you need to talk to a lot of new people every single day, week, and month.** The aggregate of those conversations will lead to new sales. 

In order for our agents to meet their appointment goals, we ask them to talk to a lot of new people every day. To that end, **we use a program called the Mojo Dialer****.** With this program, you can load lists of people in your database, your expired listings, and lots of other prospective buyers and sellers into that dialing system every morning.

We have an administrator load names of people and create lists in our dialing system each morning. Our agents then get together for about 90 minutes to two hours to do outbound dialing or prospecting. We ask that our agents dial between 60 and 100 people each morning and have 15 to 25 conversations with people they didn’t have conversations with the week before. 

Through those conversations—by sheer numbers—we can develop relationships with people, learn what their needs are, and serve them as clients and help them meet their goals. If this is done consistently, day after day, week after week, you can bet that after a few weeks you’ll be setting two to three new buyer and listing appointments each week.
