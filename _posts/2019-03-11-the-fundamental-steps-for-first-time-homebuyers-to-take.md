On the path to homeownership, **the very first step that a first-time homebuyer should take is to talk to a lender and get pre-qualified.** Once you’ve been pre-qualified, you know the exact amount you’ll have to purchase a home. Additionally, this will help you narrow the selection of homes you’re looking through—for example, if you’ve been pre-qualified for $300,000, but are only comfortable spending $200,000, you’ll know not to spend time looking at homes above your maximum price. Pick a price ceiling and a monthly payment you’re comfortable with.

**Once you’ve been pre-approved by a lender, your next step is to find an agent.** Once you’ve identified a Realtor you’d like to work with, be sure to interview them. [In a previous video,](https://youtu.be/yKrOJuztGUY){: target="_blank"} I discussed how best to interview your agents to be sure you’re working with someone right for you. This is important because throughout this process, you’ll be working very closely with them for the next 60 to 90 days of your life. Your agent should be someone you feel comfortable with, someone you trust, someone who has experience, and most importantly, someone who has your best interests in mind.
