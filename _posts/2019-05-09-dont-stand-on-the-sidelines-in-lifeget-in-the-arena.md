If you want to be successful in life, you have to get in the arena. Today I’ll tell you what that means.

*“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.”* - Theodore Roosevelt

That’s one of my favorite quotes of all time, and today I want to talk about what it means to me and how it applies to our daily lives. Actually, a couple of things happened to me recently that made me think of it. &nbsp;

First, I saw multiple people back out of buying a home because they were worried that it had multiple offers and they didn’t want to get stuck in a bidding war.&nbsp;

This kind of thing bothers me. Why wouldn’t a person want to be involved in a bidding war? If you don’t make an offer, you won’t get a home that might be a perfect fit for your family. Wouldn’t you want to at least try to make an offer? **If you don’t try, you’ll never get what you want.&nbsp;**

Second, someone challenged the stats I referenced after I made a post on a social media site that thanked Barbara Corcoran for helping make me the No. 1 agent in the capital region and my team the No. 3 team in the entire state of New York. I would never make a claim or list a stat that I couldn’t verify, so I messaged this person and showed him my references for these rankings. He replied that I should’ve listed those citations the first time around.

This person was a relatively new Realtor, so that’s when I told him he needed to get in the arena. The line itself its taken from a larger quote which you can read at 3:00 in the video above, but in any case, **if you want to be successful in life, you’ve got to be in the arena.** You’ve got to be in the game. If you want to buy a house for your family, you have to make an offer.&nbsp;

When I started my business many years ago, there was one thought that drove me: I didn’t want to be on my deathbed wondering what would’ve happened if I tried starting a real estate business. I decided that I would rather start a business and potentially fail than regret never trying at all.&nbsp;

That’s what life boils down to. You can’t be a spectator. You can’t not participate. **I’ve failed in my life plenty of times, but I’m always stretching and trying new things, and without that, I never would’ve achieved the breakthroughs I’ve accomplished.**

If you’d like to talk about how you can “get in the arena” in your own life or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
