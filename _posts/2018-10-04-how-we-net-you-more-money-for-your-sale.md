Everybody brags that their company can sell your home faster and for more money than others by using the latest technologies. To prove that we really are the best, we put many of those commitments in writing, so that when we meet with you, we can describe how we can net you on average 18% more when working with us versus another agent.

For starters, **we build buzz about your home.** Oftentimes this buzz is about homeownership itself, since agents are selling the idea of homeownership, not just the house. I think a smart marketing plan not only launches your home, but also gets people to anticipate it.

**When we price a home, we take it very seriously; it is, after all, an important, detailed process.** It takes hours of work to make sure that we get you the best offers possible. We've been very successful at pricing your home to not only get it sold, but also attract multiple buyers. This doesn't mean underpricing your home, but instead pricing your home competitively to make you shine against the older inventory.

What if things don't work out though? **We always have a plan B ready.** You need someone that is willing to tell you the truth even when it is uncomfortable because sometimes a market will shift. Or, buyers will give us feedback that helps get our seller's home sold by responding professionally and quickly. As soon as sellers are able to shift their current home to their new idea of a dream home, their current home becomes a product.

Finally, **what we really enjoy is being creative.** We have aligned ourselves with some of the most successful and energetic agents in the area. We are also members of multiple organizations around the country, which has allowed us to step outside of our arena and look at our marketing. We involve you, as the homeowner, and let you know the results we'll get with our plan, so that as we update you, you know what's going to happen. We want to share our energy with you so we can continue to increase the net for you and decrease the time on the market.

If you have any questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
