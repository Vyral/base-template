Listing your home now might be a better idea than waiting until spring. Here’s why.

Is now a better time to sell your house than waiting until spring?

With the interest rate hike that we just witnessed, **buyers are entering the market now instead of waiting until spring to purchase a house.** Not only that, but our current inventory is extremely low, and the demand from buyers is extremely high.

This makes our current market the perfect place to possibly get top dollar in a very short amount of time.

If you have any questions about current interest rates or what our market inventory looks like, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you!
