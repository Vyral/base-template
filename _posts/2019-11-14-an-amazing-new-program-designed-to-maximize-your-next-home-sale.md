Coldwell Banker has just begun to offer an exciting program for home sellers that I can’t wait to tell you about. Learn more here.

Home sellers: I’m excited to announce that Coldwell Banker has partnered with [Home Advisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/) to offer an exciting program that will help you prepare your home for the market, maximize the value of the home, and defer any costs to sell the home until closing. The program is called **RealVitalize powered by Home Advisor, and here are the details:**

To revitalize means ‘to renew or to infuse with energy,’ and that’s our goal with the RealVitalize Program. Home Advisor is a nationwide referral network for contractors, home improvement experts, and all manner of home-related projects. **We’ve partnered with them not only as a way to refer or locate qualified contractors and service professionals, but also to roll the cost of home repairs or updates into the sale of your home**—sometimes the costs of doing those projects can be a difficult burden on home sellers.

Not all projects will lead to that end, but there are numerous things that you can do to increase your home’s value. For example, boosting curb appeal, painting, updating flooring, and doing repairs where necessary are projects that can really make a difference in your sale.

**Here’s how the RealVitalize Program works:**

When you go through the RealVitalize Program powered by Home Advisor, we’ll put together a listing agreement and discuss what projects can be done to boost your home’s value. Then, we’ll reach out to Home Advisor to refer you to the best vendors in your area for whatever job you need to be done.

Then you, the homeowner, will meet with contractors to interview them and compare prices as you would normally. **Once you’ve approved a contractor, they’ll come in to do the work, and here’s the best part: Coldwell Banker will pay the vendor up front\!** When your home sells, the cost to pay the contractor will be deducted from the proceeds.

There are no fees or interest payments to worry about, either. The RealVitalize Program is a tool that Coldwell Banker has come up with to help their agents maximize their business.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, I can’t imagine why this wouldn’t sound like a wonderful program for you to consider. For any questions you have about the RealVitalize Program powered by Home Advisor, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We can discuss the entire program in more detail and figure out how it can benefit you given your unique situation.
