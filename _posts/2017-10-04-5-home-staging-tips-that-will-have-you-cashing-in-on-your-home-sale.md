If you want to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, here are five home staging tips you need to remember:

**1.&nbsp;****Offer curb appeal.**&nbsp;Change out the house numbers, the outdoor lighting, the front-door color, and put out a tasteful welcome mat. It makes your house look well-maintained.

**2.&nbsp;****Create ambiance.&nbsp;**Appeal to all five senses in your home. For sight, use lighting to brighten dark spaces. For smell, create a subtle, pleasant scent like vanilla or citrus. The key word here is “subtle,” because you don’t want buyers to think you’re hiding something. Incorporate textures or textiles that promote a personal touch. For sound, turn on some quiet music. For taste (my personal favorite), leave out a candy bowl or a water bottle with a nice welcome note that welcomes your guests to stay a little bit longer.

**3.&nbsp;****Embrace the floor space.&nbsp;**Make your house feel spacious. Put breathing room around pieces of furniture and use mirrors to reflect natural light. We tend to fill up rooms when living in a house, but when selling, less is definitely more.

**4.&nbsp;****Emphasize architectural details.** If there is a quirky space, play up its strengths. For example, turn an empty space under the stairs into a cozy reading nook.

**5.&nbsp;****Play up a lifestyle.** You’re not just selling a house—you’re selling a lifestyle. Show buyers the kind of life they could be enjoying in their new home.
