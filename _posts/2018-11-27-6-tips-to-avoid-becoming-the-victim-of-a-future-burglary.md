<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I want to talk about six home safety tips to employ if you want to keep your home safe from burglars.</em></p>

There are six things that house burglars don’t want you to know:

**1. Nighttime burglaries aren’t common.** Burglars prefer to do it during the day when they will usually find the home’s occupants out of the house. Many of these crimes take place between 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.

**2. They know you’re not home.** When it comes to social media, don’t post where you are at all times; a lot of burglars watch social media and track your movements so they can strike when they know you’re not home. Wait until you get home to update all of your friends and family about your vacations, trips, etc.

**3. They don’t like your security practices.** A home with an alarm or some type of dog is less likely to get burglarized than homes without. In fact, an alarm makes a burglary 300 times less likely; burglars want an easy target.

**4. It’s not helpful to advertise that you have guns.** Besides the fact that the burglar will then know to expect such a thing, it might also further incentivize them to rob your home, since guns sell well on the secondary market.

**5. Your shrubs and architectural items make it easier for burglars to hide.** Make sure you trim your shrubs and that you don’t have large objects obscuring your windows, or else burglars will exploit this to hide and get closer to your home.

**6. They look for valuables left in open spaces.** &nbsp;Don’t leave your valuables out in the open, especially in places where they can be seen from windows, including technology like computers and laptops. This makes for easy targets.
