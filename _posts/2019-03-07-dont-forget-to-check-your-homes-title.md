As a home seller, it’s very important that you check your home’s title before you list it. According to Ben Benjamin of Ticor Title, there are two main reasons why.

First, **there may be unseen items on the title you’re not aware of.** For example, Ben was recently a part of a transaction where the mortgage of the home being sold had been paid off but hadn’t been properly released. When you know about these kinds of things ahead of time, you can resolve them in a timely manner and avoid having to deal with any last-second drama.

Second, **it allows you to verify the home’s owner.** Specifically, if the property is in a trust or an LLC, you’ll need to review the title to make sure you have the right people in place to officially sign on behalf of it. Again, verifying this information ahead of time will give you a smoother transaction.

There’s no reason to delay having this due diligence taken care of. If you’d like us to help you check your home’s title and make sure it’s ready to be put on the market, don’t hesitate to give us a call.
