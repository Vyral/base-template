We hope you are in the market for a beautifully delicious treat, because this week Tulsa Looks Good on You is highlighting, Charcuteray.

Charcuteray welcomes you into the delicious world of cheese & charcuterie by crafting unique & beautiful spreads, and teaching you to do the same.

Jennie had a chance to chat with owner , Shiraya Proffitt to hear all about her beautiful cheese & charcuterie shop located at 1207 S Lewis Ave.

"It's the perfect party food. It's great in a city where people love food and entertaining, like Tulsa. So charcuterie boards have become kind of the perfect fit for our community," shared Proffitt.

After starting her business online in 2019, she transitioned to a store front in January 2022. Located at the corner of 12th and Lewis, the shop was originally built in 1917 as a gas station servicing travelers up and down Route 66.

â€œI think cheese boards can be unapproachable sometimes, they can be a little intimidating for people. And so we wanted to create a space that was welcoming and beautiful and people felt like they could come in and get friendly service and learn more about cheese."

From catering to individual boxes, Charcuteray offers it all. If you would like to learn more visit, [https://www.charcuteray.com/](https://www.charcuteray.com/)
