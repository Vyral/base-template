"Well I got the house that we really wanted after a process that was very competitive for the buyer of course. But yeah, very happy with the results. Chia ended up coming through, so very thankful that he was able to help us get the house that we wanted. The lender that I was using, the first lender, was actually charging me more than was expected and my agent Chia was able to get me over to, he looked at my documents and he was able to get me switched over to a lender to get me a better deal and he was able to get me to do that in a timely fashion where we were able to pull it off and we did this after a couple of weeks of working with the first lender so he did everything that was essential to make it work and in a timely fashion once again. He was there from the very beginning, throughout the whole process, very encouraging, he really helped out with that. If he had not gone through with the new lender, getting me a better deal, which saved me a lot of money, thousands of dollars then we would have lost the house that we wanted."
