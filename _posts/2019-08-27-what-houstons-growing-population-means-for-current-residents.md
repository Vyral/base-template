Houston’s population is growing rapidly, but why is this happening and what does it mean for current residents? Let’s discuss.

By 2020, Houston’s population is expected to exceed 7.1 million people. So where are these people coming from, and what does this population growth mean?

**Well, in most cases, families move to our city to take advantage of our massive job market.** And not only do we have more employment opportunities than some other major cities in the country, but we also have a lower cost of living. To top it off, Houston doesn’t require residents to pay state or income tax.

Buyers moving from up North, meanwhile, are attracted to our fantastic weather. The bottom line is that Houston has a lot to offer.&nbsp;

**So what does this mean for current residents?&nbsp;**

For one thing, a higher population will help boost our economy. And for those thinking of selling their Houston home, the financial benefits of these relocating buyers can be enjoyed more directly.&nbsp;

Despite what some might assume, newcomers to Houston won’t take any resources away from our city—rather, they’re going to help us grow.&nbsp;
