Where is your career path heading?

If you want a career in real estate, you should know that **there’s a difference between a job and a career in this business.**If where you really make your money isn’t in real estate, then you only have a job in real estate. If you’re a teacher, fireman, doctor, lawyer, etc., and you also do real estate, then it’s just a side job, not a career.

To pursue a career in real estate, the first step I recommend is **sitting down and mapping out how you want that career to look.**Plan out your short-term and long-term goals and add numbers to those goals--write down how many units you want to sell, what you want your commission to be, etc.

No one has ever conquered the world without a plan. If you can’t make a plan, you’re not going to have a successful real estate career.
