In the latest episode of Your Journey With Jennie, I sat down with Vanessa Pollock of Pollock Properties Group and Keller Williams Real Estate in Northern New Jersey to talk a little bit about her and her agents’ success secrets. I attended a great class of hers called “Care, Serve, Give” at Keller Williams Family Reunion and it blew my mind. I was so excited to sit down and pick her brain about real estate and all the wonderful things that come with it. **Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so you can skip around to the topics that interest you the most:**

1:15- An introduction to Vanessa, her business, her career development, and her business goals.

8:15- How a change in Vanessa’s mindset changed her outlook and changed the growth of her business.
