**Did you know you can use your database to serve random urgent needs in your community?** I almost quit real estate about six years ago, but instead, we decided to start a ministry and use our real estate practice to help serve urgent financial needs in our community. It’s turned into a nonprofit that’s thriving with a board, decision-making process, vetting process, and we’re able to serve 70 to 80 families per year.&nbsp;

There’s a five-step process to this, and it begins with setting up a very basic nonprofit. I have a template that can show you how, complete with a screen-recorded video, if you’re interested in setting up your own. **This can provide more purpose in your business and be a blessing to your community.&nbsp;**

If you want to learn more, type “nonprofit” into the comment section below or private message me the same thing and I’ll send you the screen recording with copies of all the documentation so you can set up one yourself. If you have questions about this or any other real estate matter, call me at (717) 216-0860 or email me at [dave@havehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@havehooketeam.com). I would love to speak with you.
