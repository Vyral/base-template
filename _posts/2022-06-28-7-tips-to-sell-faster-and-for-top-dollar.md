Now that you’ve decided to sell your home, the stress is probably starting to settle in. Here are seven steps that can get your house sold faster and for more money:

**1\. Declutter.** This can be a long process, but the sooner you start, the better. Take a good look at each room, and pack up anything you won’t need for the next few months, including any personal items like pictures. After you declutter, clean your home too. It will make it look so much brighter and bigger.

**2\. Finish those small projects.** If you’re not done with a project, finish it, but don’t start any new ones. However, you should ensure the structural and mechanical parts of your home are in working condition.&nbsp;

**3\. Paint**. You may like the purple paint in your kitchen, but it might make the room look more like a cave to a prospective buyer. Even though gray tones are in right now, studies show that buyers prefer white walls and other neutral colors. Also, polish any handles or door knobs and clean the grout between your tiles.&nbsp;

**4\. Improve your curb appeal.** Your curb appeal is the first thing buyers will see when they visit your home. The best thing you can do is powerwash your house. You’ll also want to pay attention to the front door; buyers get a chance to really look at your entryway while their agent handles the lockbox.&nbsp;

**5\. Stage your home.** Around 77% of agents say staging makes it easier for buyers to visualize living in a house. Staging also highlights your home’s best features and helps it stand out.

**6\. Get professional photos.** According to the National Association of Realtors, 67% of buyers will visit a great home they saw online. Professional pictures are a must.&nbsp;

**7\. Plan for showings.** Buyers can request a showing at any time. Until your home is under contract, you need to be able to leave it at a moment’s notice. Have simpler meals with easier cleanup and plan for plenty of outdoor activities. You should also have a place to bring your pets during showings.&nbsp;
