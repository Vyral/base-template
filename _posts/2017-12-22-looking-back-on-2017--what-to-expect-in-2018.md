Today, I want to take a quick minute to give you a recap of the 2017 real estate market, as well as give you an idea of what to expect in 2018.

Compared to 2016, home sales in 2017 stayed about the same. There was just a slight reduction year over year. In 2016, about 5,000 homes sold throughout Southwest Indiana. When I say Southwest Indiana, I mean Vanderbilt County, Ward, Spencer, Perry, Posey, Dubois, and Gibson County.

Nationally, home sales went up 0.3% in 2017. In 2018, we expect a 4% increase, which is fairly substantial. However, the government can definitely impact that with the tax reform. There are a couple of key points in the tax bill that could affect the housing market. Keep in mind that I am not an accountant, so I recommend speaking with one if you want to know more details.

That said, these three points could impact the housing market:

**1. Capping the amount of mortgage interest** a person can write off at $500,000. Given the home values in our area, this first point will not have a dramatic effect on our local market, although the next two may.<br>**2. Property taxes capping reduction.**<br>**3. Capital gains.** Right now, if you have lived in your home for two of the last five years and made improvements to your home before selling, you would not have to pay any taxes on the profit from your home sale. The tax reform wants to raise that to five out of the last eight years. You can still write off the capital gains tax, but you have to stay in the house three years longer. That could definitely play into the 2018 market.

All in all, though, it looks like 2018 will be another good year in the housing market. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
