Here are nine tips to help your offer stand out to sellers:

**1\. Pre-approval.** Have your lender keep your pre-approval current, within 20 days if possible, and specific to the home on which you’re bidding. Make sure to choose a lender that’s committed enough to go to bat for you. They should be well-known and respected among the real estate agents in your area. If the lender is truly dedicated, they’ll call the listing agent and vouch for you.

**2\. Make an offer over asking price.** Sellers frequently price their houses aggressively to incite bidding wars. Properties in multiple-offer situations are likely to sell for over asking price. The tough part is figuring out how much over asking price to offer. You should offer as much as you’re comfortable with.

**3\. Have an escalation clause.** In certain circumstances, an escalation clause can be a wonderful tool to raise your chances of beating other offers. This clause allows you to offer a certain amount over the highest offer.

**4\. Consider waiving the inspection.** Waiving the home inspection is the most assertive way to show you’re serious about the property. If you decide to go ahead with the inspection, make sure to include in your offer that you’ll cover up to a certain amount of estimated repairs—make the number high so it’s more attractive to the seller.

**5\. Shorten contingency time frames.** Shorten the inspection, appraisal, and loan contingency time frames if possible. Speak to your lender to find out what the earliest date is that the loan contingency can be removed.

**6\. Increase your down payment.** Sellers may feel that a buyer with a higher down payment of 10% to 20% is more qualified than one with 3.5% to 5%. Borrowing from your 401(k) can be a useful option, if it’s possible for you.

**7\. Be flexible on the closing date.** Some sellers have inflexible circumstances and need to sell to someone willing to accommodate their time frame.

**8\. Use an occupancy agreement.** Consider allowing a rent-back because some sellers need to stay in the home for a brief period after closing to give them time to move into their new house. This is called a seller in possession addendum and can provide some value to the buyer as well.

**9\. Consider submitting a backup offer.** A backup offer is made in acknowledgment of an existing offer and ensures you’ll have a binding contract with the seller if the first offer falls through.&nbsp;
