If you plan to sell your first house, there are four key tips you should follow:

**1. Price your home accurately**: The price is very important, so hire someone who knows your market instead of someone who dabbles or does real estate on the side. Pricing your home too high can be a killer for your first two or three weeks by making the other homes for sale in the area look better. Underpricing can create enough chaos and bids that the eventual winner might get cold feet.

**2. Make sure your Realtor can help you prepare your home for sale**: The preparation isn't necessarily about staging, but using what you have and focusing on opening up the space, cleaning it as well as you can, and making it feel as big as possible. People focus on square footage and floor space.

**3. Be flexible with showings**: Do your best to be available to leave the home if you work from home or have kids. The more open you are to showings, the quicker your home will sell.

**4. Insist on professional photography from your Realtor**: Don't listen if they say they have an iPhone or a camera of their own unless they're also a professional real estate photographer. You want a professional who truly knows how to capture a home. Pictures make all the difference online, and many buyers will decide whether they even want to see your home in person just by clicking a photo.

If you have any other questions about selling a home, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'm always happy to help!
