Today, I’m joined by a special guest to help me explain how first-time homebuyer programs can help you save.

But, who qualifies as a first-time homebuyer? According to our special guest, Rhett Delaney from Movement Mortgage, **a first-time homebuyer is anyone who hasn’t owned a home in the last three years.** There are a lot of different programs out there to fit people who fall under this qualification.

These programs include grants, non-interest bearing loans, and also something called Florida’s Hardest Hit Program, which can provide up to $15,000 toward closing costs for first-time homebuyers.

This money comes in the form of a forgivable grant. So if you live in the house for at least five years, you’re not required to pay back the $15,000. Though to qualify for Florida’s Hardest Hit, there are some stipulations.

**First of all, your credit score must be 640 or above.** Also, depending on your county and whether you’re using a conventional or FHA loan, there will be an income requirement ranging from $60,000 to $80,000.

It’s important to note, though, that only one person in a household must qualify to obtain this grant. **These funds are available now, but are on a first-come, first-serve basis.** Don’t hesitate to take advantage of this program. If you work with Movement Mortgage, the pre-approval process will take just 24 hours and underwriting will take just one or two days.

So, if you are a first-time buyer looking for a home and would like help, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
