Ashley Bommarito and Terri Dewell are two very important members of our closing team that I’d like to introduce you to today.

They work inside what we call our “engine room” because they’re the ones who make the ship go, so to speak. Specifically, Terri helps get our sellers from contract to closing, and Ashley works with our buyers to process all the contracts and assist the agents in negotiating those contracts.

**What do you love most working for the Caul Group? **

Terri: “I like being part of a team where we just...we have a lot of fun together. But we help each other, and, especially in the engine room, there’s three of us working in there and we just collaborate a lot to try to figure out ways to help our clients and get them the most bang for their buck.”

Ashley: “I’ve never not wanted to come into work every day. I really like everyone we work with. We have fun all day and we just, we play music, and I think because we have fun and we enjoy each other and our jobs that we do better for the client.”

Everyone who works in our engine room is a licensed agent who’s been on the other side of the transaction, and they also work in the field as needed, which means you get a top-notch administrator and one of the top agents in their field working for you.

**What’s one fun fact about you?**

Terri: “One surprising fact people don’t know about me is I have nine children and 10 grandchildren and more on the way.”

Ashley: “I actually love to bowl. I’m from a bowling family and I’ve won a bowling scholarship before, so I like to beat all the men on the leagues I’ve been on, because it’s just fun to be the girl that rubs it in their face (laughs).”

If you’d like to get in touch with either of these agents, you can message them on our website. If you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.
