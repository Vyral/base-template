A lot of people have been asking me recently how we find our new team members.

While behavioral assessments are a big part of this process, itâ€™s important to note that the Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.

Instead, the best thing to use is something called the Abelson DISC. By using this route, you can assess people based on a specific area of business. There is a sales DISC assessment, a management DISC assessment, and more.

**People are scored based on different categories directly pertaining to how well they might function within a role at a business.**

My team has actually developed benchmarks for every position we have that are based on categories related to this assessment. I can send you these benchmarks if you are interested.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
