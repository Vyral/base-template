Welcome back, and thanks for joining us again. Today, I'm going to be talking about how sellers can benefit from multiple offers.

As a seller, there are a few important tips you need to remember if you want to maximize what you get for your property and decrease your time on the market. We want to create a multiple offer environment with your home, to create an auction-like environment that will draw high listing prices and favorable terms.

First things first, you want to take the time necessary to stage your home properly. All buyers will have received information from your home already online, so don't skimp on the staging. It's the one thing you can control that will generate a very positive rate of return.

Secondly, you've got to make sure all marketing information about your property gets to the most people in the shortest amount of time. We typically like to let the neighbors know about the open house with a "Grand Opening" invitation. This way you can have all the buyers interested in your property in the same room at the same time.

If you have any questions for us, make sure to give us a call or send us an email. We can't wait to hear from you!
