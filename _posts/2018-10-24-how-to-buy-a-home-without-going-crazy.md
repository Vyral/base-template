How can you find your new dream home without losing your mind? Well, here are three tips to help you reach your goal:

1. **Get a pre-approval from your lender.** This will give you an idea of how much you can afford when it comes time to search for homes. Most agents won’t even show you homes unless you’re pre-approved.
2. **Consider only your top three contenders.** This helps keep things in perspective so you don’t stretch yourself too thin trying to keep up with all those listings.
3. **Stop looking at listings, already!** Once you’ve found your top three, the rest aren't for you. Just move on.
