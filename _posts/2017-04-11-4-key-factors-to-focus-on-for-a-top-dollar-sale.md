{% include youtube.html %} If you’re selling your home, there a few things you can do to ensure you get top dollar in today’s market here in Northern Virginia. When selling, pay attention to these factors:

1. **Preparation before a photo shoot is absolutely essential.** Our team pays for a consultation with a professional stager to help you understand how to get your home ready for the camera. After all, the camera is the only eye you have to please. Many people hesitate to pay for staging, but remember, a great stager will help you take advantage of things you already own. They’ll help you decide how to place furniture and what to take out of a room to showcase your home to the fullest.
2. **Pricing.** Even though it’s a seller’s market, pricing definitely matters, especially if you want multiple offers for your home. Focus your price on where it will actually sell and it will encourage multiple offers to drive up the price of your home. If at all possible, you want to create a bidding war.
3. **Drive exposure with all the buyers out there.** Exposure matters. It’s all about getting people off the couch to come see your home. For example, one of the tools in our toolkit is our “Coming Soon” marketing. We actively market our listings before they go live on the market to create a “buzz”. Basically, we want to make a splash when your home goes active on the MLS. We’ve even sold homes in a day or less, using this strategy. We also have a full-time Marketing Manager who exposes your home to more than 300 websites. It’s not just about Zillow and Realtor.com; we want to maximize the eyeballs on your home.
4. **Make sure you work with a Realtor who can negotiate top dollar for your property.** Preparation, pricing and exposure are all absolutely critical, but you need a seasoned professional to drive home the highest possible price. It’s the difference between marching down the field and fumbling the ball on the 1-yard line or marching down the field and scoring a touchdown. There’s a lot of psychology and knowhow in knowing how to manage multiple offers to secure the highest price. With more than 30 years in the business, I’d be honored to show you what it’s all about and how our team can help you get the most for your home.
