How do you be purposeful and strategic in how you make changes to your business? You look at the numbers and adjust accordingly.

Today in the sixth installment of my webinar series about the fundamentals of real estate, I’ll show you how to utilize your multi-year trend report and look at it in relation to the business plan you’ve put together so you examine the right numbers and make the right adjustments.

**Here are timestamped sections of the video above so you can jump ahead to certain points at your leisure:**

0:40 - A quick review of what we’ve learned from previous videos.

2:11 - Explaining the CGI tools of the Career Growth Initiative.

3:51 - The agent trend report—where you can find it and how it can help you stay on track with your listing goals.

15:10 - Why you need to ask “Why?”

19:10 - The numbers that can and can’t be tracked in the multi-year trend report and where you can go to find the numbers that aren’t tracked: &nbsp;[Daily104.com](http://Daily104.com){: target="_blank"}.

20:04 - The activities that are tracked on [Daily104.com](http://Daily104.com){: target="_blank"}.

23:34 - The final piece of analyzing your multi-year trend report and how it breaks down where you’re at with your four conversations: appointments, listings taken, closed units, and GCI.

27:20 - How focusing on two conversations, your number of appointments, and the number of listings taken can tell you what activities need to change in your business.

This is the same playbook that the best agents in the country are running; it’s just a matter of modifying the effort and activity within that model. If you haven’t already done this with your first quarter numbers of 2018, I encourage you to download your multi-year trend report today and use the second quarter to get back on track.&nbsp;
