<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are plenty of reasons why selling during the holidays makes perfect sense. Here are three of them.</em></p>

I’ve been hearing from clients who are excited about selling their homes, but they’re curious about whether they should wait until spring or whether they should get them on the market now. **Here are a few reasons why right now is a great time to sell a home:**

**1. Holiday buyers are serious buyers.** In the spring, there are plenty of buyers who are just curious about looking at homes and not 100% committed to making a move. If a buyer is looking during this time of year, they are definitely wanting to buy a house now.

**2. There is less competition.** When there are fewer homes on the market to compete against, your property will stand out to the current, serious buyers. Once the first of the year hits, we’ll see inventory pick up very quickly. By April, you’ll be competing against twice as many homes.

**3. Holiday decorations give your home charm and character.** During the holidays, there is a much more emotional attachment to purchasing a new home that’s really difficult to duplicate at any other time during the year.
