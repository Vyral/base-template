If your home sale or purchase has fallen out of escrow due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are plenty of ways to still get a deal done.

If a home falls out of escrow due to the coronavirus pandemic, what happens next? At the end of March, we had six homes fall out of escrow in a 5-day span. One buyer lost their job, another couldnâ€™t get financing, and others got cold feet.

I can now tell you that of those listings that fell out of escrow, four out of six are back in escrow. One of the homes has actually sold for a higher price than it previously did. To learn how this happened and what you can do if your home has suffered the same fate, watch this short video.
