If you want a pool on your property, is it better to purchase a home that already has one or to install one yourself? Today we will provide some insight into these options.

First of all, it is important to note that the most sought-after pools in today’s market are concrete or gunite. **The typical cost of these types of pools ranges from between $40,000 and $110,000.** This figure does not account for the additional expenses of landscaping or fencing.

As a general rule, pools tend to add between 10% and 20% of what they cost to install onto the value of a property. So if you spend $100,000 on a pool, your home value will only increase by $10,000 to $20,000. Therefore, homeowners who opt to install a pool should expect to lose money overall.
