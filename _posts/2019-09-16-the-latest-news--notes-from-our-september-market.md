Can you believe it’s already September? 2019 has really flown by, and the real estate market is still buzzing. We’ve been extremely busy here at RE/MAX Professionals, and there are a few reasons why.&nbsp;

For one thing, **inventory is low—the lowest levels I’ve seen in many years.** Properly priced homes are selling within days after being listed. In fact, we listed two houses this past week in different price ranges that sold within a few days. If you’re thinking about selling, now is definitely a good time to do so.&nbsp;

**Interest rates are also very low right now**—as low as 3.5%. Mortgage rate projections for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the MBA, and the NAR are about 3.62% for the rest of 2019. This is great news if you’re a homebuyer.&nbsp;

If you’re a homeowner, these low rates mean now might be a good time to refinance. We know a great financial team we can refer you to who can get you refinanced in just a couple weeks.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying, selling, or refinancing, don’t hesitate to give me a shout. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
