Homebuyers: If you’re still on the fence about buying this year versus waiting until next year, today’s message is for you.

I really think now is still a great time for you to buy. **Interstate rates are still at historic lows, so take advantage.** Whether you have good or subpar credit, speak with your lender to see what you qualify for. You may be surprised at what you can afford and what options you have. Inventory is slowly increasing, which means there are more homes to choose from and reduced competition from other buyers.

If you don’t qualify for something that you’ll want to use this year, it’s still a good time to talk to a lender because they’ll help you know exactly what you need to do for the upcoming year so that you’ll be ready when the time comes. You’ll have time to get your credit in order and save up enough money for a down payment or other out-of-pocket expenses.
