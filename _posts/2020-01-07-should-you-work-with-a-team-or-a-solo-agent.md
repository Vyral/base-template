<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Working with a solo agent and working with a team come with two different sets of expectations. Here’s what you need to know.</em></p>

Today I want to talk to you about real estate teams. Why do they exist, how do they work, and how does my team operate? I’m answering all of these questions and more today.

**First of all, a real estate agent is going to be either a solo agent or part of a team.** There are advantages and disadvantages to both routes. If you have a solo agent, you’ll be working with the same person all the time and they’re going to handle everything for you and be your sole point of contact.&nbsp;

However, as many of us have found, we’re better able to give service to our clients if we bring in help through a team. **The advantage of a team is that someone with specialized skills is always available**, and you won’t be limited by working with just one person throughout the process.&nbsp;

I was a solo agent for eight years, but have been on a team for the last seven. **I found that I couldn’t do everything involved with real estate myself and still be the best for my clients.** Real estate involves so many things, such as marketing, sales, paperwork, advertising, project management, etc. Those elements each require different skill sets.

The light bulb turned on for me after I went to the dentist. I realized that the dentist wasn’t the one scheduling appointments, giving the X-rays, doing cleanings, and billing clients. The dentist just does the exam. **I realized that we’re not so different in that we focus on doing the most important things at the highest level.**

When you work with the Ask Sarita Team, you get the entire team on your side. We have people who specialize in paperwork, we have a transaction coordinator, and we have buyer’s agents and listing agents. My job as the team leader is to write every offer, take every listing, and work closely with my clients throughout the process.

We helped 144 families last year with over $80 million worth of real estate. I’m much more involved in my transactions than other teams that are doing similar numbers. We aren’t going to ever sell 1,000 homes a year, but that’s just fine with us. **Our main focus will always be to give you the best possible service.**

If you have any questions about real estate teams or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
