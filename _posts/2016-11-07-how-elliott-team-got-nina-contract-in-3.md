And we got above our asking price. We sold our house, we had a contract within 3 days of putting it on the market. The entire process they went above and beyond. They were always there, we got updates on email, we were able to contact Doug when we had questions. Very responsive, very considerate and I find everything that his whole team did was very professional, timely, excellent."</span></span></i>
