Today we’d like to answer a great question one of you recently asked us: “Should I sell my house over the holidays?”

This is a great question, so I’ve asked The Peterson Team’s lead listing specialist, Diane, what she thinks.

According to Diane, now is an absolutely great time to sell. There are three reasons she says this is the case.

**1. Less competition.**A lot of sellers take their homes off the market during the holidays. This means you can get a better price for your home, since buyers have fewer properties to choose from.

**2. Buyers looking at homes during the holidays are serious.** Anyone who is on the market for their next home at this time of year is going to be very motivated.

**3. Buyers can lock in on lower monthly payments.**Very rarely does the Fed raise interest rates during the fourth quarter. This means buyers can afford to pay more for your home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
