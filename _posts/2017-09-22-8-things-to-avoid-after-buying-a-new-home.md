Today, we’ll be discussing eight costly missteps new homeowners make in their first year.

**1. Going with the lowest bid on projects around the home.** It’s a good idea to get multiple bids on the different projects you’ll be doing, but going with the lowest bid isn’t always the wisest move. Make sure you are researching all the different contractors available to ascertain whether or not they’re reputable—just because they have the best bid does not mean they do the best work. Check reviewing sites to make sure the bid you choose will stand behind their work.

**2. Submitting small insurance claims.&nbsp;**It’s never a good idea to submit small claims to your insurance company, especially if they’re close to your deductible, because it will end up increasing your insurance rates in the long term. Try to take care of small issues yourself to avoid this unnecessary increase.

**3. Making improvements without checking the return on investment (ROI).** If you do any improvements to your home, be sure that you’ll get a good return on them, or be prepared to absorb something that doesn’t give you that return. For example, putting in a new $50,000 swimming pool will probably not get you a return on your investment. Some people want one anyway, but just make sure you understand that you’re probably not going to recoup your money on a project like that.

**4. Going on a furnishing spree.** Spending thousands of dollars on new furniture isn’t a good idea after buying a new home, especially if you put that on credit. You’ll have to pay that off over time, and many times you’ll be charged outrageous interest rates if it's not paid off quickly. Don’t overextend yourself.

**5. Throwing away receipts and paperwork.** Keep all the papers from closing your home not only for the warranty, but also for when you resell the house. If issues should arise with the buyer (perhaps with disputes over improvements made), you can easily pull out the paperwork and save yourself money.

**6. Ignoring small items on your inspection report.** If you buy a used home, there will likely be a lot of things you can’t get sellers to fix. It’s important to address these issues as soon as possible once you’ve moved in, so they don’t become bigger issues down the line. For example, simple gaps in your siding can lead to water penetration and ultimately water damage inside of your home. Address these issues soon to avoid the cost and headache.

**7. Remodeling without doing any research.** You should always have licensed, competent contractors take care of your remodeling—you may run into any number of issues while remodeling your home yourself if you aren’t properly trained to do so.

**8. Buying cheap tools.** We’re all on a budget. When you move into a new house, you’re trying to save money, so naturally you may want to buy the lower priced tools. But these cheap tools don’t last. Buy quality tools, especially if they have lifetime warranties, even if you have to pay a little more for them. Breaking and replacing tools regularly will be costly and just add to the time it will take to complete a project.
