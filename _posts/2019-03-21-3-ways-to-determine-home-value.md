If you want to find out how much your home is worth, there are three different ways you can determine its value:

1. **Use an online valuation.** This method will give you a very general understanding of what your home is worth. In other words, don’t expect the value to be exactly on the mark. Online valuations are simply a starting place—not a final assessment.
2. **Hire an appraiser.** An appraiser’s opinion will be much more accurate than the figure you’d find using an online valuation. Appraisers examine sales data from your area to determine your home’s value. Essentially, they compare the features of your home against similar homes that have sold in the past to determine what your own property might sell for. The downside to this option is the cost. Hiring an appraiser will run you somewhere in the ballpark of $500, and it may take a week or two for you to see their results.
3. **Ask your agent for a comparative market analysis (CMA).** This service, which I personally offer for free to all of my clients, is very similar to an appraisal. A CMA essentially involves your agent looking at your home compared to other similar properties in order to determine its value. Size, style, features, and upgrades are all taken into account during this process.
