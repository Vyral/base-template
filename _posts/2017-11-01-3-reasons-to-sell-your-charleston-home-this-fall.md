Many people get discouraged when they think about selling their home in the fall or winter season. There are actually three really compelling reasons why **fall may be the best time to sell your property.**&nbsp;

Maybe you’re thinking, “Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. I just don’t want to think about putting my house on the market.”&nbsp;

If that’s the case, I can tell you that all of your neighbors who plan on selling their homes are thinking the exact same thing. They will wait until spring and summer to do so.&nbsp;

If you put your home on the market in the fall or winter, **there will be fewer homes on the market for yours to compete against.**&nbsp;

Buyers also tend to be more motivated during the fall and winter. Some life circumstance has caused them to have to buy a home now, so those are two important things to consider: less competition and more motivated buyers.&nbsp;

Finally, there is no better time to take listing photos of your home than the fall. Your home will look amazing. We’ll put those photos online and do what we do best—market your home, bring buyers to you, and get top dollar for your property. &nbsp;

This year, there is another reason to list your home on the market during fall or winter.&nbsp;

We’ve had several storms coming up the east coast which, combined with a number of other factors, have caused the real estate market to be a little slower the second half of the year. &nbsp;People have been waiting for the storms to pass or for school to start up again before entering the market.&nbsp;

As a result, there is a lot of pent-up demand.&nbsp;

**These buyers are working with us in real time to find the perfect home,** which is just another reason to put your home on the market, sell quickly, and get your asking price this fall or winter.
