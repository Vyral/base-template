Congratulations—it’s almost closing day!&nbsp;

However, before congratulations are fully in order, and before the keys are handed over to you, **there are a few things you need to do in order to be prepared for the closing table.**

Clients often ask what needs to be done to schedule their closing. We encourage our clients to take time off from work on the day of their closing. That way, they’ll have all the time they need to get their documents and financing in place, and also to be able to go and see the house after they’ve closed on it.

It usually takes about an hour to get all the paperwork signed at the attorney’s office, but you may want to prepare to spend a little extra time there, just in case something pops up at the last minute.

You’ll also need time to do a final walk-through, which happens usually within 24 hours before closing. This is the time for you to go through the house to check for any damage that might have occurred since your last visit.

Lastly, **you’ll need to bring certain documents with you to the closing session**, including your driver’s license and anything else that pertains to your home.
