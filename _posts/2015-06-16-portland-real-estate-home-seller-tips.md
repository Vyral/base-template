Now is a wonderful time to sell a home in Portland, and so today I wanted to speak about the best way for you to price your home.

The good thing to know is that even if you price it way below market value, it will likely shoot back up to the proper price. That's just how real estate works.

However, if you price your home too high, it will likely sit and go stale. Portland is a relatively polite marketplace and people don't often try to low-ball an offer on a home.

My recommendation is to price just below what the home is actually valued. This way you can create excitement and draw in a multiple offer situation. The home must also be positioned correctly, and we can form the correct strategy for you to get top dollar for your home.

If you need any assistance selling your home in Portland, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always willing to help!
