The numbers are in from the February 2018 market. Let’s review them and see where the market is and what we can expect heading into the spring and summer months.

First, there were 3,599 new leads this February, which is down 0.1% from the same time last year. So far in 2018, new listings are up 1.2%. There’s not much of a story to be told there other than we don’t have that many new properties coming onto the market compared to this time last year.

**Closed sales are down 9.5% from 2,261 in February 2017 to 2,044 closed sales in February 2018.** Inventory is lower this year than it was last year. We ended the month with 4,612 homes on the market, which is down 12% from 5,149 homes for sale the year before.

Overall, inventory is about 12% lower, which means that we’re going to see at least 10% to 12% fewer sales this year.

What does this mean for the average San Diego home seller?

Low inventory means that home prices are going up.

In the last few days and weeks, interest rates have started to climb. With the threat of a potential trade war, rates may continue to climb. On the other hand, the trade war could slow some of the markets down and cause rates to soften. Only time will tell.

**What we know is we are back above peak pricing in most markets.** Year over year, we’ve seen about an 8% increase in the median sales price of a home in San Diego.

Attached condos and townhomes are selling between $400,000 and $490,000, and the average and median for detached homes are $603,000 and $775,630. Those are some really healthy numbers, but what’s next for affordability?

Even though interest rates have gone up, prices have gone up as well, so we are still holding strong in the low 20% range. Historically, affordability shifts happen when affordability is in the high teens. The current range tells us that we have some room to grow.

If you are a buyer, the time to buy was really six months ago because rates were still lower. However, you should buy a home now. **They are still historically low, and you should lock in that rate before they go up to 5%.**

If you are a seller, be careful. Don’t try to time the market. We don’t know how much longer these market conditions will last, &nbsp;so it’s a great time to get your home listed in San Diego.

If you have any questions about buying or selling in this current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
