Let’s look at Swan Lake, Echo Lake, and Lake Blaine. In Swan Lake, there were eight home sales this year, up from the five we saw the year before. We also saw two vacant land sales in 2017.There is one pending sale there right now, too.

Echo Lake saw two sales this year, down from the three they had the year before. An interesting thing to note is that one of those two sales was for $1.8 million.

We’ve seen just one sale on Lake Blaine this year. There just isn’t that much out there. We won’t ever have very high numbers there. There are seven vacant land plots and 11 active listings here. There is one pending sale for $1.5 million.
