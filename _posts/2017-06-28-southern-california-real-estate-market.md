</i><div style="text-align: left;">How does the summer market look in our area? Before we launch into the update, I wanted to let you know that we have a [couple of links](https://www.tripsavvy.com/4th-of-july-events-in-los-angeles-4140338) for a [list of all the local](https://www.tripsavvy.com/4th-of-july-events-in-the-la-valleys-and-canyons-4140391) fireworks shows happening on July 4th. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Inventory has increased since April. Thats fairly typical of this time of year, where we see an uptick in inventory as the spring season moves into summer. The properties are still selling, but the inventory numbers have definitely increased. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">In the end of April, we had about 2,200 homes for sale in the entire San Fernando Valley, and now were looking at almost 2,700 properties that have been listed. In Porter Ranch, there were 65 properties for sale in April, and now youre looking at closer to 90 properties.<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">With these numbers, the inventory is still quite low. <div style="text-align: left;">With these numbers, the inventory is still quite low. **Obviously there is more to choose from for buyers than there was a few months ago, but that inventory is still quite tight.** Furthermore, even though were seeing more properties come onto the market, it doesnt make much of a difference in inventory because demand is so high. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">You can really see that reflected in the amount of closed escrows, which is up 30% from this time last year. In May of this year, we saw over 1,700 closed escrows in the San Fernando Valley, which is up from 1,300 in May 2016. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The other big news is that the Fed raised the interest rate again, but the rates really havent been that affected. Were actually hovering around 4.5%, and buyers are currently qualifying with rates between 3.75% and 4% interest. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">Right now the market is still very strong and properties are selling if theyre priced correctly. If you have any questions or youre looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call. Id be happy to help you!<div style="text-align: left;">  style="text-align: left;">
