I was delighted to be recently joined by Micah Han and Rosalie Coburn from Patterson & Associates Insurance. We talked a little bit about insurance and why it’s important for your home, as well as the different ways they give back to those in need just like our team does.

Patterson & Associates is an independent insurance agency. **Because they aren’t married to one company, they get to shop the market in order to find the best option for that particular customer.** Micah and Rosalie work together to make sure that their clients have the best insurance coverage possible.

In addition to providing great customer service, Patterson & Associates has a passion for giving back to the community. Each quarter, they have a “charity of the quarter” that they partner with. For each referral they get, they donate a portion of the profits to charity. They also send the person who gave them the referral a gift card. This quarter, the charity they are working with is called “Christian Works.” This is a charity dedicated to helping young children through the grieving process. They will donate a portion of the proceeds from each referral to this organization. **They will also hold an event for them at the end of the quarter.** It’s fantastic that they are doing so much to help out the local community.
