The housing market in the Washington D.C. area and Northern Virginia has been booming! 

According to an article published by the Real Estate Business Intelligence, the median sale price today is over $30,000 higher than it was in May of 2012. Low inventory and a demand for homes have continued to put pressure on prices raising the median sales price in most of the DC metro area.

Inventory is very low despite the ‘recent surge in new listings.’ This is good news for sellers. A properly priced home in good condition will fly off the market. In fact, the median-days-on market is just nine days.
