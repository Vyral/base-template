We all know there are a lot of amateurs in the real estate sales business—a lot of beginners, part-timers, and people who are content to do just a couple transactions a year without achieving a mastery-level, professional-grade service.&nbsp;

If you’re watching today’s video, I know your aspirations go well beyond that: You want to provide the highest levels of service to your buyer and seller clients. How can you sharpen your selling skills so that you achieve this goal?

First, **attend professional real estate classes so that you can educate and train yourself** and have the confidence to take action when working with buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

**Once you’ve got an educational baseline, it’s time to start using what you’ve learned**. This may mean going door to door if you’re trying to find sellers, or calling expired listings. It might also mean working in a geo farm or hosting an open house.&nbsp;

Don’t be merely entertained by the learning process and hope that alone will give you mastery over this business. So many agents are afraid to get in front of buyers and sellers until they feel like they have the answers to every question and they’re able to overcome every objection, but here’s the thing: The dynamics of this industry are always changing, and none of us ever know all the answers.&nbsp;

**The key to achieving mastery-level, professional-grade service is to get in the game.** Get face to face with a buyer or seller. That’s when everything you learned in the classroom will start making sense. Once you’ve gathered some experience working with buyers and sellers, you’ll have a much better understanding of the gaps in your knowledge and which of your skills need to be honed and sharpened. Then you can go back to your designation class and read everything with brand-new eyes. Your skills have been honed and sharpened by your experience, and now you’re at an intermediate level. You’ll be hearing and learning things you didn’t learn the first time.&nbsp;

After that, you can get back in the game and start the cycle all over again throughout your career: Gather experience, and go back to the classroom with the specific intent to improve skills that need further development.&nbsp;

In other words, don’t become a classroom junkie. Learn the basics, and get in the game. If you repeat this process, you’ll be on the path to mastery and have professional-grade skills before you know it.&nbsp;
