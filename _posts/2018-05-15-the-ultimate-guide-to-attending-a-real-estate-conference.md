As an agent, attending a real estate conference can be extremely overwhelming. With all of the different options and information, how do you know what to implement into your business? Today, I have three key takeaways to make your next real estate conference successful.

1. Go to the conference with one thing in mind. You can go in there with many ideas, but focusing on one thing will allow you to get more out of the conference.

1. Network smart. You’ll meet many people, and receive many business cards. Year after year, I’ve had to hand off a stack of business cards to my staff, as I didn’t have the capacity to follow up. I’ve learned to add people to social media immediately after meeting them, so that we can stay in touch.

2. Ask yourself these three questions. Before you leave the real estate conference, there are three major questions you need to ask yourself. What is one thing you plan to implement in the next 48 hours? What is one thing you plan to implement in the next two weeks? What is one thing you plan to implement in the next month?

Thinking about these three things at your next real estate conference will allow you to get the most you can from the money you’re investing in your real estate career. If you have any other questions or are interested in furthering your real estate career, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
