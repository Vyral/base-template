One question people often ask us is, **“How long does it take to go from contract to close?”**

Basically, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. The length of time between contract and close is negotiable like everything else in the transaction. However, the average length of this period tends to be between 30 and 60 days. If you’re making a cash purchase, though, the process can be sped up to around two weeks.

**Buyers who plan to make their purchase using a loan should plan for a longer period of time between contract and closing.&nbsp;**
