{% include youtube.html %}Doing these three things will get your home sold quicker and for the best price.

If you’re looking to sell your home in 2017, there are three things you can do to sell for the most money in the shortest amount of time.

First, **price it right from the beginning.** Home values are in a certain range and if you go just a little bit below the median of that range, it will be the price that brings the most interest in the shortest amount of time.

If you price your home at the top of the value range, other homes might sell before yours if they offer similar benefits but are priced more competitively. You don’t want to end up sitting on the market for two or three weeks. If you do, you’ll have to keep dropping your price and buyers will sense the desperation to get your home sold.

Second, **have all of your repairs completed before you put it on the market.** It would also be a good idea to get a pest report done. That way you show the buyer a finished product and let them know you have done your due diligence.

Finally, **make sure you declutter.** Some houses need to be staged and some don’t, but every home needs to be decluttered and depersonalized before going on the market.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m happy to help!
