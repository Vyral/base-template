We get asked all the time about when the “perfect” time to sell a home is. Here’s what I’ve been telling people lately.

One of the most common questions I hear on a day-to-day basis from clients is, “When should I list my property for sale?” I’m here to answer the question today. **Some things have changed, but these are the reasons you should consider listing in the near future.&nbsp;**

Broad marketing is one. Also, the number of properties for sale has been declining for years now. **Right now, we’re at the lowest level of inventory that we’ve seen since the National Association of Realtors started keeping records.&nbsp;**

Demand is high and prices are steady in our real estate market. Because we’re in an election year, things could change down the road. What we do know is that there is a good opportunity out there for home sellers.

If you have a home or property that’s not serving a purpose, this is a good time to sell it. It’s a good time to move up or downsize as well. There are a lot of different opportunities.

**Finally, one thing that doesn’t get a lot of press is that interest rates are still super low.** Lending regulations and qualifying regulations are making it easier and easier for people to buy, increasing your buyer pool
