<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What’s it like to be part of the Dave Hooke Team? Check out what one of our team members has to say in today’s agent spotlight.</em></p>

The Dave Hooke Team is made up of real estate professionals who are truly second-to-none in our industry. I’m so proud of the people I work with, in fact, that today I’d like to introduce you to yet another great member of my team: Andrew Johnson.&nbsp;

Andrew has held several different positions here on the Dave Hooke Team, and has, therefore, gained a unique perspective and skill set—something he touches on in our recent interview (which you can check out in full by watching the video above.)&nbsp;

**From buyers agent to sellers agent to his current role as an inside sales agent (ISA), Andrew has seen all sides of the business.&nbsp;**

Now he really feels that, in his words, he has “found \[his\] niche.”&nbsp;

Andrew’s future in real estate wasn’t always so clear, though. Until he discovered the role that felt like the right fit for him, he was so close to leaving the industry that he had a job offer for another position elsewhere in hand. Lucky for us, he ultimately changed his mind. Why?

Because of our team environment. He said that the Dave Hooke Team challenged him in all the right ways, while still supporting him through all of the struggles he faced as he searched for his niche in the industry.&nbsp;

**Speaking on behalf of my entire team, we’re so grateful to have Andrew on board with us.** Beyond that, we’re also very thankful to have cultivated an environment in which people like Andrew, who perhaps weren’t always sure that real estate was their perfect path in life, were able to discover a route in this industry that made sense for them.&nbsp;

With all of that said, I hope this message has given you a better idea of what life is like on the Dave Hooke Team. If you have any questions or would like more information about what we do, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
