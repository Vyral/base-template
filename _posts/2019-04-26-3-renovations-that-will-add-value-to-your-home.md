As you prepare your home for the market, certain renovations are a must. **You want to renovate in ways that will attract buyers without spending excessively** (and sometimes unnecessarily).&nbsp;

Here are three renovations you can make that will add value to your home at little cost:&nbsp;

<br>**1\. Paint your home.** By adding a fresh, neutral coat of paint to your walls, you’ll bring greater energy and life to your home. As a bonus, it’ll actually aid you in the decluttering process so your home will be in shipshape for showings.&nbsp;

**2\. Renovate your hardwood floors.** If your wood floors are scuffed up or looking a little dull, make sure to repair them and renovate them in such a way that buyers will take notice of and respond positively to them. After all, first impressions are everything, and floors with scuff marks are one of the first things that will catch a buyer’s eye. If your home is carpeted, in most cases, it’s best to remove it and showcase the wood flooring.&nbsp;

**3\. Ensure your kitchen and bathrooms are show-ready.** Data tells us that buyers who do a total rehaul of their kitchen don’t tend to see much of a return on their investment, but making yours look clean and tidy is very important and can be done at low cost. &nbsp;

<br>I hope these three quicks tips gave you some valuable insight into what buyers want to see from your home once it’s on the market.
