There are literally billions of dollars sitting around in unclaimed bank accounts, retirement funds, and federal and state income tax refunds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I wanted to share with you a couple of ways to determine if you (or your family members) are owed any money and how you can go about claiming it.&nbsp;

Let’s assume that you have moved and forgot to close some bank accounts.&nbsp; Or think that you closed checking or savings accounts—but they may still be active.&nbsp; Depending on your state, banks are required to transfer those funds to the state of your last known addresses.&nbsp; You can visit&nbsp;[www.unclaimed.org](http://www.unclaimed.org/){: target="_blank"}. &nbsp; If you find your name on the list, you can request your cash online.&nbsp; You can also request the money not claimed by a deceased relative with proof of death and executor information.

If you have owned a life insurance policy, or think a deceased relative had one, you can also find it on&nbsp;[www.Unclaimed.org](http://www.unclaimed.org/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp; Start with the name of the agent who sold the policy.&nbsp; If you don’t know the name of the agent, go to&nbsp;[www.naic.org](http://www.naic.org/){: target="_blank"}, run by the state’s insurance agencies. &nbsp;And if you or a deceased relative was in the military, check out&nbsp;[www.insurance.va.gov/unclaimedfunds](http://www.insurance.va.gov/unclaimedfunds){: target="_blank"}.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;![](/uploads/cash-062519.png){: width="349" height="154"}

Finally, did you have a pension or 401K with a previous employer?&nbsp; If they are still in business, contact them.&nbsp; If not, you may be able to find if there is any money due you by going to&nbsp;[www.freeERISA.com](http://www.freeerisa.com/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp; Or if your 401K company fund was terminated, check out&nbsp;[www.askebsa.dol.gov/abandonedplansearch](http://www.askebsa.dol.gov/abandonedplansearch){: target="_blank"}because you may still qualify for a payment.&nbsp;

If you believe that you have money due you, but can’t find it, there are people who can do it for you.&nbsp; They will take a cut of the found cash.&nbsp; But whatever you do, DO NOT PAY them upfront.&nbsp; Reputable companies will not take a cut until they recover the money for you.&nbsp;
