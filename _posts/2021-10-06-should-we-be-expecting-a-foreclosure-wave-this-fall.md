At a conference last month of mortgage service companies that work with real estate agents on bank-owned properties, they announced that over **80% of homeowners** that went into forbearance after the pandemic started are now current on their mortgage.

What is a **forbearance**? It is when a mortgage service company, lender or bank allows homeowners to pause making payments and move those missed payments at the back of their mortgage. So, it will just add up the months that payments is missed at the end of the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

When the pandemic started, **1\.6 million homeowners went into forbearance**. Now, 80% of those homeowners, are now current on their mortgage. Of the remaining 20%, **15% of those will not be able to pay their monthly mortgage** because prices have increased significantly. These people will be able to walk away with equity. In the San Fernando Valley, there is 30-25% increase in price since March of this year.

Now the remaining 5%, or only 80,000 nationwide, will be in **foreclosure** and will be gobbled up quickly. This small number will not affect the inventory in the market, hence it **will still be a strong market**. In Los Angeles, we still have under 2 months of inventory and under a month for Porter Ranch.
