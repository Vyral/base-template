If you want to sell your home that's currently being rented, should you try to sell it through the leasing company? Here's why I advise against it.

There are a few common questions I've received in recent weeks that I wanted to address for you.

**Q: Is there any benefit to choosing a team of real estate agents versus a leasing company?**

A: A client had a home rented and was looking to sell it. The people leasing the home really wanted to list the house. I told them that the problem was that they wanted to list the houseâ€”not try to find a buyer and sell it in a reasonable amount of time for top dollar.

Someone once told me that when you ask someone to do something they don't normally do at a very high level, you probably won't get the best results. Just like you wouldn't call your kids' orthodontist for a root canal, you shouldn't call your leasing company to sell your house.

If you have a home that's rented that you're looking to sell, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help!
