Why is it important to stage your home when you list it for sale?

If you’re living in the home while it’s listed, remember that buyers might not identify with the type of furniture you already have laid out. There is a life cycle that every house goes through, and each buyer wants to see what they’re looking for. If you’re moving out and you’ve already purchased a home, you don’t want to leave an empty house—only a small fraction of buyers can actually visualize themselves in an empty space. Staging is not only crucial to help buyers envision themselves in your home and feel connected to it, but **it’s also proven to help homes sell faster and for more money.**

There are great stagers and not-so-great stagers. How can you know the difference between the two?

A great stager will be your design expert and help you understand the layout of your home’s space. You can trust them with the placement of things and they’ll also bring high-quality furniture. A bad stager won’t care about what furniture you use or rent the same furniture that everyone else does. They’ll bring their furniture on lawn mower trailers and not care about what kind of shape it’s in or if that furniture mixes with your home or not.

When you interview stagers, understand what styles they’re using and make sure they keep that style consistent throughout your house. In addition, double check the quality of the furniture they use. Staging furniture travels from house to house, but a good stager will have a crew in place to move it carefully.

**The costs associated with staging can vary depending on the size of your house.** You can expect to spend anywhere from $800 for a very small house with a couple rooms to thousands more for a full staging of a larger house. If cost is an issue, consider working with a real estate agent who will take on staging expenses as part of their marketing or commission.

**There are two types of staging: actual staging and virtual staging.** Actual staging means physically bringing furniture into your house. Virtual staging means using computer technology to stage your online listing photos.

Virtual staging is gaining popularity because it’s a lot more cost effective than staging with actual furniture. The problem with virtual staging, though, is that if it elicits someone’s interest enough to visit your home and you haven’t physically staged it, they’ll have no choice but to look at empty rooms. This can lead to the problem I mentioned earlier of most buyers not being able to visualize what they want in a vacant home.

Of these two options, **I recommend actual staging.** I see the benefit of virtual staging, but your money is better off spent on actual staging. Get a good stager with high-quality furniture and you will absolutely have great results.
