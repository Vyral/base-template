Today I just wanted to talk briefly about agency with you. In most transactions, there is a buyer’s agent and a seller’s agent. We’re focusing on the buyer’s agency side of that in this blog.

**One of the main duties of a buyer’s agent in a real estate transaction is to protect the buyer who is making a large financial investment.** It makes a lot of sense to have someone looking out for your best interest.

A few days ago, I was talking to a homebuyer who told me that they had received an offer from their current landlord to buy the home she was renting for $230,000 to $250,000. That’s a pretty wide range of value, so I asked her how she was going to determine the price, if she wanted representation, etc.

I then had her text me her address to determine if the price was fair. **I ran the numbers and long, story short, one of the best comparables I found for the home was actually right under $200,000.** That’s $30,000 lower than the lowest price the landlord was willing to sell for.

She hasn’t bought the home yet, and for that I’m glad. She would have been getting ripped off, more or less. As a professional, this is part of my job. I wanted to make sure that this buyer was making a proper investment, but she would have just been overpaying for it if she decided to buy.

If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying a home in Boise, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
