What does the selling process look like, and how does my team’s approach differ from that of the average agent?

**Most Realtors use what’s called the “3 P Method” when helping clients sell their home.** As the name implies, this involves three steps:

- Putting a sign in the yard.

- Putting the home on the multiple listing service.

- Praying that it sells.

These things are a good start, and our team follows all the same main steps as most other agents, but we also do so much more. Today I’d like to give you a brief overview of how my team and I approach the selling process.

First, **we use our exclusive Home Selling Action Plan.** We are extremely proactive and constantly searching for potential buyers. We don’t just sit back and wait for buyers to come to us. So how does this plan work? Let me break it down:

**1. We have an initial consultation with our sellers on the phone.** During this call, I ask you questions specifically designed to determine what you want from your home sale.

**2. We meet at the listing.** This meeting will last between 30 to 60 minutes, during which time we will walk from room to room and discuss our strategy for showing and, eventually selling, your home.

**3. We hire a professional photographer.** Unlike some agents, we know that cell phone photos aren’t good enough to be used in marketing materials for your home. This is why we enlist the help of someone whose job is to capture fantastic, flattering photos of your home.

**4. We prepare to market your home.** This starts when our team launches your pre-marketing campaign, which is a 10-step program designed to maximize your listing’s exposure in the market.

**5. We launch our exclusive 10-day marketing blitz.** Your home will be marketed to every potential buyer out there, promoted to every licensed Realtor and their buyers, and syndicated to all real estate websites. This exposure will lead to a high level of traffic and, therefore, a high number of offers. From there, our team will negotiate with the top competing buyers and help you earn top dollar for your home.

This is just a very, very brief glimpse at everything we do to get your home sold. There’s so much more that goes into this process.

If you have any other questions about this topic, would like more information, or have any other real estate questions or needs we can help with, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
