Home selling can be complicated and often leads to many questions. Here are three of the most common questions that we’ve been hearing, as well as our expert answers:

**1\. Can I sell my house when it’s vacant?** Yes, you absolutely can. You don’t have to rent furniture or have the vacant home staged, either. Sometimes, it’s better not to have any furniture than having old and outdated furniture. If you have good paint and carpet, a vacant home can show very well.

**2\. Do I really need to paint or make other home improvements before selling?** You certainly can sell your home without making cosmetic improvements, but you won’t sell it for as much money as you could have. Buyers will start looking at things they’ll have to do and take that off of their offer. If everything is taken care of when they come in, you can get a much better price. Sometimes, the investment in carpet and paint can really pay off.&nbsp;

**3\. Do I need a radon test in order to sell my home?** The short answer is no. However, you are required to disclose any previous radon tests that you’ve had done to the property.&nbsp;
