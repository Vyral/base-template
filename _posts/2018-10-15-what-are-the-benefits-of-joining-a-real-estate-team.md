  Joining a real estate team isn’t a move that every real estate agent should
  make. However, there are quite a few advantages that agents who are part of a
  team can enjoy.

Why should you join a real estate team? I hear this question a lot. Our team has five licensed agents in addition to myself, and here’s what I think about real estate teams.

**A team environment is not for everyone.** It’s for agents who want to make good money, who want to sell, and who don’t necessarily need to have their name out there in lights.&nbsp;

**Here’s how my team is set up.** I have five buyer’s agents and I take care of all the listings. In addition, I have a director of operations, a listing manager and am currently hiring a transaction coordinator. I also have three unlicensed assistants, as well as a full-time runner.&nbsp;

We are a full-service team with our own office and we work pretty independently. **Our goal is to make life awesome for our agents by providing leads, transaction coordination, and other support.** If you like working with a team and like the camaraderie, we provide a ton of value.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

The agents on my team have minimal expenses. They pay for their MLS fees and dues, but we pay for all the leads, marketing expenses, and office expenses that they might have.

A lot of agents get hung up on the splits. What I’d say to that is that **100% of nothing is still nothing.** On a team, you can make more money than you can as a regular agent, and it’s much more consistent too.&nbsp;

Being on a team isn’t easy, especially if you’re an agent on my team. I want people who are dedicated and focused on their careers and who want to work hard. I listen to what agents want and take it very seriously. If you tell me you want to make $150,000 per year and you aren’t taking the necessary steps to get there, I will let you know that and push you to reach your goals.&nbsp;

**My team members don’t have to pay for coaching because I am their coach.** I provide resources, support, and a full CRM for our agents. I also hold them accountable to their goals.

In a nutshell, that’s what it’s like to be on a team like mine. I’m always looking for great team members so if you think you have what it takes based on what you’ve heard, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.<br>&nbsp;
