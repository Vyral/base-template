A couple weeks ago, I did a video blog about some of the proposed changes happening with the new tax bill. However, two of the changes I mentioned didn’t happen. This ended up being good news, though, because it impacted the real estate market positively. &nbsp;

The first would-be change was the capital gains exemption. Originally, they intended to change the current rule, which is that you must live in your house two out of the previous five years in order to get the capital gains exemption of $250,000 per person. What they intended to change it to was that you must live in the house for five out of the previous eight years.

This change was negotiated out at the last minute, though, and **the rule is staying the same—you must live in your house for two out of the previous five years to get the $250,000 capital gains exemption.**

The other would-be change that was negotiated out at the last minute was the mortgage interest tax deduction amount. The original rule was that you could deduct the interest you pay on a mortgage for up to $1 million (or $1.1 million, actually). The proposal was to lower this deduction to $500,000.

Instead, **they only lowered it to $750,000.** This means you can still itemize out the interest you pay on your secondary home or vacation residence as long as that home plus your primary residence doesn’t equal more than $750,000.

All in all, these last-minute changes ended up being less harsh on the real estate market, which is great news.

If you have any questions about these changes or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
