As of right now, we have 329 active listings available in Montgomery County, with a little over 100 of those homes being new contraction, and we have close to 590 sold units. The biggest differences between last year and today are the average list price and sales price, which both increased by $40,000 year over year. Home prices continue to rise, making now a good time to purchase a house.

If you’re in the market to purchase, here are a few things you can do to ensure that you’re on the right path:

**1\. Get pre-approved.** It’s critical to get pre-approved so that you can be sure that you’re shopping for homes that fit your budget. You don’t want to fall in love with a home only to find out the bank won’t approve you for the asking price.

**2\. Budget for out-of-pocket expenses.** Two such expenses to keep in mind are the home inspection and the appraisal.

**3\. Be ready to act now.** Sleeping on a home may mean that you won’t be sleeping in it. If you wait too long in this competitive market, many other buyers will be looking at the same house you are. If the home has a few issues, that’s okay; those are things you can address over time. Just be ready to leap on it as soon as you can.

If you’re looking to sell your home for the most money possible, keep these tips in mind:

**1\. Check that everything is in working order.** Keep an eye on all your home systems like your HVAC, plumbing, and electrical, especially before you put your house on the market. That will save you time, money, and energy later on. If your home goes under contract, you don’t want these things to come up as major issues on the inspection.

**2\. Curb appeal.** First impressions are everything; the smallest details could mean the difference between a buyer stopping at your house or driving right by it.

**3\. Be ready to negotiate.** Buyers may want you to take care of some repairs, so confer with your agent about what is worth taking care of on their behalf.
