Here we are in the holiday season, with just a few days remaining in 2018. During this season, it’s the perfect time to look back and recognize our many blessings.

Here on the Crystal Coast, we had the wind knocked out of our sails when we were hit by Hurricane Florence. Currently, homes and businesses are slowly, but surely, being put back together. Despite this year’s earlier hardship, our area is still an awesome place to live, work, and visit.

On behalf of my fellow agents here at the Star Team, I want to say **thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you.** We look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come.

If you are interested in learning more about current market conditions or are in need of representation during your next home sale or home purchase here on the Crystal Coast, give me call at (252) 241-9210. We hope you have a Merry Christmas, a Happy Holiday season and a happy 2019.
