When homeowners get ready to sell, one of the most common questions they ask is: “How do I price my home properly?”

Most people believe they need to elevate their price to leave room for negotiation in order to sell. **That sounds logical on the surface, but it could end up being a big mistake.**

Pricing a property over its market value will lower the chances of buyers coming to look, especially in this market. When we have fewer buyers coming to look, we have a lower chance of getting an offer. The old saying that “you can never go up on price” is not true in real estate if you have an agent who knows how to handle multiple-offer situations.

**If you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, I would love the opportunity to show what I can do for you.** If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
