If you work through that, you can be a successful agent. \n \nThe freedom and flexibility is great, but many agents leave because they are not used to holding themselves accountable.

I love football, and I am a Seahawks fan. Plus, we’re in the process of building our own home, so we’ve got our hands full right now.”\n \nAccording to Brandon, the best thing about working in real estate is that you have the potential to provide a lifestyle for your family. “I never thought I would be able to come out and build on property,” says Brandon. “Police officers aren’t paid very much. They aren’t paid enough. We see that all the time and it’s unfortunate, but I wanted to be able to build a home and provide a life for my kids. I don’t want to have to say no when they ask to play this sport or go to dance school. My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.” \n \nBrandon is a great person and a great real estate agent. I hope this has given you some insight into who he is.

Today, I’m excited to introduce you to Brandon Evans, one of our real estate agents. The Agent Highlight series will help you get to know some of the agents that you’re working with.
<br>
<br>Brandon worked as a police officer for about five years. “I have a lot of respect for police officers, but it just wasn’t my area of expertise,” says Brandon. “I had some good learning experiences, but it just wasn’t my thing.”
<br>
<br>“I came across the Keller Williams website, started inquiring more about it, and met with someone in the Riverton office,” Brandon adds. “She sent me down here, and I had several positive conversations that let me know that **this is the place where I wanted to work.”**
<br>
<br>Brandon continued working graveyard shifts while he went through real estate school. “Then I got set up with David and the rest is history,” Brandon says. “I found the right home.”
<br>
<br>One of the biggest challenges Brandon faced when he dove in as a full-time real estate agent was the financial aspect. “I spent 20 years working hourly jobs and getting a paycheck every two weeks, and this job is sales,” says Brandon. “I got one deal in three months and it wasn’t that big—I only got $1,200 from it—but everything counts. Then, it started clicking, things started rolling, and I’ve had a pretty steady paycheck since then.”
<br>
<br>One of the things I’ve noticed over the years is that agents get into real estate for two reasons: an unlimited income ceiling and flexibility. However, those are also the two reasons why people leave. They think they will immediately make money and that there won’t be any lag between your efforts and your results.
<br>
<br>**The truth is that you will work for at least 90 days before you see any income,** and it will take about six months before you start to see consistent income. If you work through that, you can be a successful agent.
<br>
<br>The freedom and flexibility is great, but many agents leave because they are not used to holding themselves accountable. As a result, they don’t keep up with the tasks they need to generate the kind of results that will provide for themselves and their families.
<br>
<br>Family is very important to Brandon. “I’ve been married for eight years now, and we have four kids,” says Brandon. “We like to get out and do some motorcycle riding, and I’m a fan of all sports. I love football, and I am a Seahawks fan. Plus, we’re in the process of building our own home, so we’ve got our hands full right now.”
<br>
<br>According to Brandon, the best thing about working in real estate is that you have the potential to provide a lifestyle for your family. “I never thought I would be able to come out and build on property,” says Brandon. “Police officers aren’t paid very much. They aren’t paid enough. We see that all the time and it’s unfortunate, but I wanted to be able to build a home and provide a life for my kids. I don’t want to have to say no when they ask to play this sport or go to dance school. **My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.”**
