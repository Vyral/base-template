Today we’re going to talk a little bit about pricing strategy. Here’s how you can make sure your home is the first one sold in the neighborhood.

**There are four key factors that affect a home sale most:** location, condition, pricing, and the right agent. About 90% of all of our strategy is going to happen up front, so we spend a lot of time strategizing where to list your home in order to best position it compared to the competition out there.&nbsp;

**We have to look better and we have to have better amenities inside and out.** That means paying attention to detail so that we can sell first. If our competition is priced better and is in better condition, we have to sit and wait for them to sell. We would rather be first in line.

When it comes down to picking the right agent, our job is to increase demand. We have a marketing program that's designed to get more eyeballs on your house. When we have the best condition and the best pricing strategy to go along with it, your home will be the first one sold in the neighborhood.

If you have any questions for us about our strategy, or anything else relating to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.<br>&nbsp;
