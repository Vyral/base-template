How important is curb appeal when making a first impression?

Curb appeal is extremely important. Buyers often like to drive by a home so its vital that your lawn is manicured. If you have children, limit the number of toys in the area. Clean up the oil stains on the driveway.

Just as important, if not more, is how your home looks online. Did you know that 95 percent of buyers start their search online? The photographs and virtual tours are the determining factor whether a buyer wants to take the time to see your home in person.

You need good photographs and a proper staging to showcase your home in the best way possible.  Your online profile is like an open house to buyers behind their computer screen. Put your best foot forward.
