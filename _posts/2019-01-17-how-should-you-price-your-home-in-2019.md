For most of 2018, we had a really hot market due to the low inventory in the resale market. In the summer of 2018, we only had approximately 5,000 properties for sale; at that time, if a house was worth $350,000, you could have gotten away with pricing it over market value. 

As of today, we have 9,300 properties available. In our current market, if your house’s market value is $350,000, you’ll want to list it at $340,000. **Due increases in both our inventory levels and in the competition in the market, you can’t get away with pricing your home over market value.**

We’re going to have another great year in 2019, but we don’t anticipate a market frenzy like we saw in 2018. A normal market in Las Vegas usually has around 9,000 homes for sale, and we’re right at that point. **This is a normal, healthy market for us.**

If you’re looking to buy, our market is also great because there are more options to choose from.<br>Whether you are thinking of buying or selling your home, feel free to reach out to me directly for a free consultation.
