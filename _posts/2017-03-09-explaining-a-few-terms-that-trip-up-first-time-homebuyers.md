What are some real estate terms that often trip up first-time homebuyers? We’ve compiled a list of them and explained each term’s definition to give you a better understanding of the home sale process.

<br>**Mortgage pre-approval:** A mortgage pre-approval is when a lender looks at all of your financials and determines what you can qualify for in terms of a loan or a mortgage.<br>**Escrow:**Escrow is a neutral third party that helps both parties in a transaction with any funds that need to be held on either party’s behalf.<br>**Impound account:** An impound account can be chosen by buyers and starts after escrow closes. This holds your property taxes, insurance payments and pays them on time. Every month, part of your monthly payment goes toward these homeowner expenses that would otherwise be a large lump sum payment.<br>**Earnest money deposit:** When you put an offer on a property, a seller wants to know if you’re a serious buyer. To demonstrate that you are, you put down an earnest money deposit which is typically 3% or less of the purchase price. This money is deposited into escrow until the purchase is complete or until you decide to cancel the purchase. The earnest money deposit will go towards your total down payment.<br>**Contingencies:** Contingencies are a type of condition that you put in place when you submit the offer to protect yourself as a buyer. For example, there is an inspection contingency that allows you the time to do inspections and back out of the transaction if you find something you can’t live with.<br>**Property taxes:** There are two types of property taxes associated with properties. One is your base tax rate, which the county will assess. The second is Mello Roos Tax. This is a supplemental tax that is specific to a certain development. Mello-Roos is also called a CFD on a tax bill, which stands for community facilities district. This can be a major improvement like a road or a school district that’s added to your property tax bill. Not all communities within a given city have Mello-Roos. Typically, you’ll find this in newer communities, and Mello-Roos has a defined time before it expires and you no longer have to pay it.<br>**Final walkthrough (before you close):** This is an opportunity for you as a buyer to walk through and make sure the house you put an offer on is still in the existing condition or in a better one if repairs have been made. The final walk through is typically done 3-5 days before close of escrow.<br>**Estimated closing statement:** This will list all of the closing costs.<br>**Closing costs:** There are both buyer closing costs and seller closing costs. These are the different fees associated with the closing of a home.<br>If you have any questions about any of these terms or anything else about the world of real estate, please feel free to reach out to us at your convenience.
