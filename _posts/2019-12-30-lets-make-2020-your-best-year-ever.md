<p style="text-align: center;"><em>2020 will be a year of change for the real estate market. You should also let it be a year of change for you.</em></p>

2020 is upon us\! We’ve just come off 11 years of a bull market run—it will be 11 years officially in March of 2020. Interest rates are currently down, and we’re still seeing good market activity in certain areas and price points. Here’s what we can expect in the market with the arrival of a new year.

If you have a 2,500-to-4,500 square-foot house (some might call these homes ‘McMansions’), sales are expected to accelerate over the next few years as baby boomers age. Many of my clients are selling those homes and moving south to warmer weather. If you’re thinking about retiring and you own one of these houses, it’s a good time to sell. My thought is that we’ll see a glut of homes with larger square footages on the market in the Capital Region.

Speaking of the New Year, have you made your New Year’s resolutions yet?

I know—change is difficult. **We won’t change until the pain of staying where we are becomes greater than the pain of changing.**

As I reflect on 2019, I first just want to say thank you to everyone for making it such a great year. We try to give back to our community by doing a ton of charity for Miracle Children’s Network, Toys for Tots, and all the other causes we donate to. We couldn’t be more grateful for your support with those causes.

Here’s a lesson 2019 taught me:&nbsp;

So many of my clients have gone through hardships, from health-related issues to job loss. This has taught me that life is short. **Don’t wait until you can’t change to try to start changing.** Make 2020 your best year ever\! Sometimes that might involve changing yourself, the environment around you, or both.

I hope you take this to heart\! I go to conferences all the time, yet I learned that only 3% of people who go to conferences actually learn something that they’ll implement in their lives. That means 97% of people who attend conferences are wasting their time traveling there. They might have met a bunch of great people, but they don’t implement anything they’ve learned there.

Make 2020 your year of change. I guarantee that you wouldn’t rate each and every aspect of your life a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10; wherever you feel like you’re lacking in life, take this new year to improve.

If my team or I can do anything to help you make this coming year the best ever, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you and help you plan to make 2020 a great year of change.
