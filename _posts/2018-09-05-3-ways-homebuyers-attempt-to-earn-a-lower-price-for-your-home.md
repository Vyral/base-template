These days, many buyers are attempting to renegotiate price after an agreed-upon contract is in place. As a seller, it’s important to watch out for these unscrupulous home buying strategies. There are three main ways this bait-and-switch tactic can manifest:

1. **Tying up the house.** If you get an offer that is much higher than any of the others, comes with great terms, and has very few contingencies, you probably have a buyer who is &nbsp;trying to “tie up the house.” This strategy essentially involves submitting an amazing offer in order to push other buyers out of the picture. Buyers who try this believe that once they’ve got you under a contract, they can renegotiate their offer and secure the home without following through on the things they initially promised.<br>&nbsp;
2. **Requesting an inordinate number of repairs.** Another way today’s buyers attempt to pull one over on sellers is by submitting a lengthier-than-necessary repairs request. These homebuyers overstate the number and severity of the issues found during the inspection period and ask for a lower price as compensation.<br>&nbsp;
3. **Changing the terms while in escrow.** Sometimes, buyers who initially seemed to have solid loan terms will attempt to switch things up after you’re already in escrow. With the deal already well underway, these buyers will announce that they’re interested in pursuing a riskier loan option. In some cases, these loan options can even implicate you, the seller.
