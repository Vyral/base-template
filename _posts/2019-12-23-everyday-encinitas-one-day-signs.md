<center><em>I recently met with Marco San Antonio, of One Day Signs, to discuss what his business offers to the people of Encinitas.</em></center>

<br>Today on “Everyday Encinitas,” our quest to spotlight local businesses and community organizations, brings us into the company of Marco San Antonio, owner of One Day Signs.

One Day Signs has been a staple in Encinitas for more than 30 years and boasts a rich history. It started back when Marco’s father Omar retired from the U.S. Navy after 22 years of service and went to Hawaii, where his brother owned a sign shop.

Inspired by the business model, Omar relocated to Encinitas to open One Day Signs, which he and Marco operated together for many years before Omar’s retirement last year; Marco is excited to be the new owner.

It’s truly incredible what the San Antonio family and their team are able to do; **producing high-quality signs in one day or less isn’t easy, but it has become their brand**.

I’ve relied on One Day Signs many times for my real estate signs, but can anybody off the street come in and request a sign? Absolutely, says Marco, who also added that **people can get just about any type of sign**, from garage sale signs to banners, and even large ‘For Lease’ signs.

One of the keys to One Day Signs’ success is that everything can be done right there on site; Marco likes to control the entire process that way, ensuring that he and his team are the ones helping customers design and draft whatever signage they need.

According to Marco, One Day Signs is a cut above the competition because of the deep commitment to service and the quality end product customers receive. So if you’re out and about, **stop by <u><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/iqW5B18qnCgYYpV2A">the shop</a></u>, located by D Street and Encinitas Boulevard, just north of the large Encinitas sign. Otherwise, you can <u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.onedaysignsencinitas.com/">visit their website here</a></u>**.

It was a pleasure to meet the San Antonios. If you’re a local business or a community organization who would like to be featured on the next episode of Everyday Encinitas, please reach out to me by phone or email. I’d love to feature you\!
