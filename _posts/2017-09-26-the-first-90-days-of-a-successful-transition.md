The first 90 days are essential to ensuring a successful transition. We’ve got some tips to share that will help you make the first 30, 60, and 90 days of your transition a success.

**The first 30 days is a learning stage.** At this point, you want to be a sponge and absorb as much information as you can about the company, its culture, leadership, and more. This is when you should start to form relationships with coworkers. The most important part is to understand your boss’ expectations and how to meet and exceed them.

**The last 30 days of the first 90 days is the transformation stage.** This is where you become a full-fledged member of the organization. This is a time when people join clubs or committees within an organization. The big thing to remember here is to avoid the mistakes you made in the previous 60 days.
