The other day, we played dodgeball to help out Children's Cancer Connection. We weren’t sure exactly how much our dodgeball skills would hold up, but when we heard there was a team costume contest, we knew we could at least compete there.&nbsp;

**We really enjoy being involved in the community,** and one way we do that is by asking what’s important to our agents. This dodgeball tournament was Children’s Cancer Connection’s first one ever, but they have a volleyball tournament that we attend every year, at which we always have a ton of fun.

We have an agent, Jason Hennis, whose family was affected by childhood cancer, and they took advantage of the amazing program that Children's Cancer Connection offers. It’s been a part of their life for a long time, and it’s wonderful that he has brought us into that fold. Plus, the events are super fun\!

If you are not familiar with their work, Children's Cancer Connection sends kids with cancer to camps. That way, they can be around other children who are going through the same thing. It’s definitely tough for kids with cancer, but the foundation also looks after the siblings. They have a camp for siblings as well so that they can find the support and friendship they need. **It’s such a wonderful idea, and it comes at little to no cost to the families.**

When you go to the events, you can tell that everyone there has benefited from the program, and they are so grateful. It proves how great the organization is.

Also, **a portion of every transaction our team does goes to charity.** This past month, we heard that the Mighty Maddy Mission was doing a special drive for some of their projects, so we reached out to them. We also contributed to the Helping Hand of Indianola, a food pantry organization.

**We have funds available to donate in the coming months**, so if you have a cause that’s important to you and in need, please reach out to us. We’d love to help with causes that are part of our community.

If you have any questions or would like to suggest a charity, just call or email us. We would love to hear from you.
