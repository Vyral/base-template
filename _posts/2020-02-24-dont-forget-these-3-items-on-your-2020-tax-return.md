<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’ll remind you of items you should include on your 2020 tax returns.</em></p>

When you finally get around to filling out your tax returns, don’t forget to include the following three items:

**1\. The interest rate on your mortgage.** Every year, the bank through which you got your mortgage will send you a 1098 form, which states how much interest you’ve paid over the year. That interest is deductible on your tax returns.

**2\. A property purchased in the last year.** On the final settlement sheet from your home purchase (if there has been one), you’ll be able to find prepaid taxes and prepaid interest—both of these items are tax refundable.

**3\. Energy-efficient credits.** If you have done any energy-efficient improvements on your home such as replacing your old windows, water heater, or air conditioning unit, you might be eligible to get a tax credit. Before you do your taxes, be sure to check for any energy-efficient tax credits that might apply to you.
