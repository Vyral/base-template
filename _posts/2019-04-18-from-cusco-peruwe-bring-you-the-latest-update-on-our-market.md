{% include youtube.html %} Today we’re coming to you all the way from Cusco, Peru, where we’re giving you a bit of a sneak peek into a special report we’re preparing on what we’re up to here. As part of this Mastermind trip, we even got to explore the wonders of Machu Picchu\!

Now, let’s turn our attention to today’s topic: The two problems buyers and sellers create for themselves at this time of year in our market—namely, when they wait to act at an opportune moment.

Sandy, a loan officer with Century Mortgage and someone who has at least four decades in the industry under her belt, has some great news for buyers and sellers right now: **In the last six weeks or so, interest rates have continued to tumble downward**. Further, based on all economic reports we’ve seen, rates aren’t expected to swing upward through 2019.

If you’re planning to buy soon, there’s truly no time like the present, because waiting until June or July will only put you up against more competition. Additionally, a home you find today may end up coming with a higher purchase price later, so you’d fare better from purchasing and getting into that home sooner rather than later.

As for sellers, sure, there will be more buyers pouring into the market in June and July, but there will also be increased inventory as well. Competition among sellers will be fierce and, as such, waiting might mean an inability to maximize your home’s sale price.

We have a team of more than 22 agents who are ready and willing to help any buyer or seller in our market. **No matter which you are, our market is full of opportunity to come out on top in your transaction.**

If you’d like to get pre-approved to buy, please give Sandy a call at 502-417-5626. And if you’d like to see what homes are out there or put yours on the market, reach out to me at 502-376-5483. We look forward to hearing from you\!
