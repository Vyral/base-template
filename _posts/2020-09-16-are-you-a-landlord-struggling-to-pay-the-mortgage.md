<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re a landlord struggling to pay your mortgage, now there’s help.</em></p>

If you’re a landlord, I have great news. **The Rental Property Owner Preservation Fund was established by the governor’s office to assist rental property owners** here in Arizona. This program helps eligible landlords who have been directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to make their mortgage payment due to nonpayment by a tenant. This program has some limits, but it can certainly help many landlords.&nbsp;

The rent amount you apply for cannot exceed $2,000 per month per property, and overall financial assistance from this fund cannot surpass $50,000 per landlord. You can only apply for expenses accrued from April to August 2020.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to fill out the application for property owner assistance, you can do so here.** If you’re a landlord you can apply yourself, or if you use a property management company, they can apply on your behalf. These are grant funds, and they come at a first-come, first-served basis. So if you need assistance, apply soon.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this program or want to invest in real estate, please give me a call or send an email. I would be glad to help.&nbsp;
