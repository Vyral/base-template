Today it’s my pleasure to introduce you to one of the new agents on our team, Daniel Pust.

Daniel is happily married with a young son in 1st grade. He grew up in the Santaquin/Payson area and still lives there because he loves it. He worked in law enforcement for seven years and eventually became a detective before transitioning into real estate.

Ironically enough, he came into his new profession through a failed transaction, which inspired him to educate himself about our line of work. When he bought his first home in 2004, the market was so hot he hardly remembers even talking to his agent at the time. Three years later, he and his wife had built up quite a bit of equity in that home, and when they found their dream home up in the Santaquin mountains, they decided they wanted to buy it.

Unfortunately, the two agents who worked on that transaction didn’t know what they were doing and it cost them that home purchase. That experience inspired Daniel to take it upon himself to treat his clients with professionalism, stay on top of what’s going on, and provide them with whatever they need, whether they’re buying a home or selling one.

Daniel chose Keller Williams because of the education we provide. As a detective, his job was very demanding, and KW offered training sessions that were compatible with his schedule. He also credits his mentor for taking time out of her busy schedule and encouraging him to stay involved. He ended up here at the Canovo Group through knowing someone who also worked here whose life was transformed positively because of the experience. Working with fellow agents Dane Hill and Ali Garbero on a transaction, which he describes as an “amazing experience,” also sealed the deal.

Daniel’s goal is to establish our brand in South Utah County. He works hard every day and has run into quite a few people who want to move but haven’t put much thought in how they’re going to do it. He enjoys being able to provide a resource for them. Daniel is a person who has both his clients', friends', and family's best interests at heart. He’s full of integrity and will do the right thing regardless of how it impacts him and his business.
