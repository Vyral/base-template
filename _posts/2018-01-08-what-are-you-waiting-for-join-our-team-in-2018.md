What is your plan for 2018? Did you hit all of your goals for 2017? If not, I invite you to join our team.&nbsp;

**You have to have achievable goals in real estate, and you need to make them on a yearly basis.** Every time a year ends, tons of agents come to me telling me they didn’t sell as many homes as they planned to, and when I ask them what their plan is for the next year, they tell me they don’t have one.&nbsp;

So if you don’t have a plan for 2018, what are you waiting for? Have you ever considered joining a team of top-producing agents? We have agents on our team who made over $150,000 in their first full year with us, and they want to make even more next year because they have a growth mindset.&nbsp;

We also offer top coaching—I personally spent close to $40,000 in coaching that I provide for all of our agents.&nbsp;

**Have a game plan on how 2018 will look for you and your finances moving forward** without the baggage of so many real estate bills and the promises of big firms that don’t come to fruition.&nbsp;

If $140,000 or $150,000+ in your first year sounds good to you, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

In the meantime, have a great 2018!
