Winter is here, which means it’s time to take care of some basic home maintenance items in order to avoid major damages and expenses down the line.

Winter is here, and we’ve had our first official snowfall. As a homeowner, there are a few things you need to do to protect your home from damage and avoid major expenses.

First of all, you need to remove your hoses from the hose bib. If you have the older kind of hose bib, you’ll need to put a cover on it. Newer hose bibs do not require a cover.

**Secondly, although icicles may look really cool, they are not good for your roof at all.** Find out why those icicles are forming and get someone out there to remove them. Do not try to remove them yourself. Hire a professional. Icicles can cause roof damage and cost you thousands and thousands of dollars.  

Finally, caulk your windows and make sure that your doors are sealed. Caulk the baseboards and walk around the outside of your house to check for any other gaps. Get everything caulked and sealed up. If you were to add all of the cracks and crevices together, **the average house has a 3x3 foot window of air coming into the home.**

If you have any questions or need referrals to any professionals to help you with these maintenance items, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
