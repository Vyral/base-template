What is the best way to win a multiple offer situation?

In today’s seller’s market, this is a great question. To help me answer it, I enlisted the help of our lead buyer specialist.

There are three things he recommends you do. First, **get a pre-qualification letter from the most reputable lender in Memphis**.

Secondly, you should decide how much over asking price you’re willing to pay. It’s important to go in with your best offer.

The third step is to **write a personal letter to the seller and let them know what their house would mean to you**.

At the Peterson Team, we use strategies to help our buyers find homes before they even hit the market. We like to help people go into their new home before the sign goes up.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
