If you’re a buyer and you find yourself in a multiple offer situation, I have two key tactics for you to follow that will help you win that home:

The first is to **get pre-approved by a local lender* before making your offer. This act will add a lot of credibility to your offer, not only because you got pre-approved, but also because you worked with somebody local. A local lender will have a lot more skin in the game to get your deal to the closing table.

The second tactic is to **give a very small window of opportunity for your seller to respond.** If you make an offer on a home today, whether you know you’re competing or not, do not give the seller 48 hours to respond. Don’t even give them 24 hours. A sharp listing agent will take your offer, show it to all the other listing agents who have seen the home, and use that as leverage to get more offers for their seller. By giving a small window of opportunity to respond, you can prevent this from happening and increase your chances of getting your offer accepted.
