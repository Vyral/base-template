Today, I’ve got a special announcement about an upcoming event that I’m excited to tell you all about.

**Beginning at 6 p.m. on Thursday, November 30, we’re hosting the Deuce Kirk Team Client Appreciation Party at the Signature Club**. The address is 3256 Lansdowne Drive, Lexington, KY 40502. Drinks and appetizers will be served.

This party is for you. Without you—our client, associate, or friend—our business wouldn’t be where it is. **We’re very thankful and appreciative for all that you’ve done for us**.

We hope to see you there!

As always, if you or someone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, please let us know. We’d love to help.
