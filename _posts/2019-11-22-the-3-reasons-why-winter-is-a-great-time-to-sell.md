The winter months are a great time to sell your home, and there are three reasons why.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, the upcoming winter months are a great time to do so, and there are three reasons why:

**1\. Low inventory.** In the entire San Fernando Valley, we currently have about 1.75 months of available inventory. In the 91326 ZIP code, there are 59 homes for sale, which is a 38% drop compared to the summer months. Low inventory equals less competition from other sellers.

**2\. Buyers tend to be more serious during the winter months.** If they’re out and about looking at homes during the cold weather and holiday season, they typically have a good reason to be doing so.

**3\. The internet doesn’t have any seasons.** Roughly 98% of all buyers start their home search online, and people have more time off during the holiday season to search for homes.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, homes listed in December, January, and February tend to sell quickly and with multiple offers.&nbsp;
