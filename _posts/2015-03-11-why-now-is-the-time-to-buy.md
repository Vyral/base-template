{% include youtube.html %}Affordability is at an all-time high right now. Interest rates are low (below 4%), and loan products from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are allowing consumers to buy with only 3% down. Even rates for private mortgage insurance have dropped, and this can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan. It's difficult for me to imagine a better time to purchase, and on top of these financial incentives, I have five more reasons why owning a home is beneficial to you.

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. Home ownership leverages your money: If you purchase a home, it's likely going to appreciate in price, so you own an investment that you should make a profit on. Other than regular maintenance, there is not a whole lot you have to do to profit off of this investment.
2. You're paying anyway: You have to pay for housing either way, so why help to pay off someone else's mortgage when you rent a home? When you own a home, your monthly payments go towards an investment that you can gain equity in.
3. It's a forced savings account: You're making a monthly payment, a portion of which goes toward your principal balance, and in 15 or 30 years, you will have the savings of your home's value.
4. Tax incentives: Property taxes are deductible, and mortgage interest is tax-deductible. There are many tax cuts that you receive when you own a home as opposed to when you pay rent on a property.
5. A home protects against inflation: When inflation occurs, your home gains value, so your equity increases and your wealth does too.

If you're renting right now, I highly suggest you start considering a home purchase. Homes are wonderful investments for the future, and there are actually a lot more benefits to home ownership than I could discuss in the time frame of this video.
