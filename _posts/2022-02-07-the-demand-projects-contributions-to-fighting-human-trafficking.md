What The Demand Project does for the Tulsa area community is just so amazing. I recently sat down with Kristen so that she could share what the organization is all about and why her work is so invaluable.

The Demand Project was born around nine years ago, and it was founded due to a horrible story from 2004 about a two-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by her father. He had recorded the incident and put it online for others to watch. It was so awful that Kristen felt that she had to do something about it.&nbsp;

The organization was formed to cover the gaps in the system, help prevent sexual exploitation from happening, protect those who need it, and help victims recover when awful things do happen.

**The Demand Project can hold presentations just about anywhere to help people better understand the extent and nature of the problem of human trafficking.** They host an Aware Workshop that works with parents and teaches them how to keep kids safe online and out on the streets. There, you can learn how to identify and fight sexual exploitation—if you see something, then having the resources and knowledge to say something can make all the difference.Kristen also recommends that anyone who is serious about learning how to combat these issues check out other, similar organizations like [Shared Hope](https://sharedhope.org/), the [Polaris Projec](https://polarisproject.org/)[t](__notset__), and the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/HOME).

If you’d like to get involved, **T****he Demand Project could use the extra time, money, and resources to keep up the good fight.** They’re always looking for house guardians for their campus, respite care, office assistance, and much more. Visit [www.TheDemandProject.org](http://www.thedemandproject.org) to learn more about who they are, what they do, and all the ways that you can lend a hand to keep our children safe.

If you have any questions or would like to hear more about how you can become more active in the community to help keep the Tulsa area wonderful, don’t hesitate to give me a call at the Wolek Group. I’d love to have a conversation with you\!
