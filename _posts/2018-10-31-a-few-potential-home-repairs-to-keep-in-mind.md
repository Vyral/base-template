  Expensive potential repairs can really cause homebuyers to steer clear of a
  property. Here are a few examples.

Today I want to talk to you about some of the more expensive things in a home that may need to be repaired or replaced. Buyers are often drawn into homes by a fabulous kitchen or an updated bathroom. While it does cost a lot of money to make a lot of these repairs, they aren’t always necessary. **Here are a few expensive home repairs that could greatly affect the price of a home:**

**1. A roof.** Roofs are very expensive. If a roof is near the end of its life, I’ve seen buyers walk away from a deal because they don’t want to have to replace it in the next few years. Oftentimes, buyers don’t even think about this until they get to the home inspection because they’re more focused on cosmetic items.

**2. Heating and air systems.** This is something that will come up during a home inspection as well.

**3. Water heaters and other appliances.**

**4. A weathered deck.** You can’t entertain on a deck that’s falling apart. You want to make sure it’s structurally sound before buying or selling a home with one.

These are some of the big-ticket items that homebuyers and sellers should be looking at before they finalize their transaction. If you have any questions or need any real estate assistance in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
