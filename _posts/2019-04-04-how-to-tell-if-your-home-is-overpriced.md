When a home is listed for sale, there are only two things we can control about it: its price and condition. **You may have heard that selling a home is a “price war and a beauty contest.”** That is definitely true.

So how do you know if you’re losing the price war? There are a couple of ways that you can tell. First, if you put it on the market and there are few or no showings in the first month it's listed, that is a signal that the market is not willing to pay your price and it might be time to make some changes or discount the price.

Every showing begins online, so you definitely need to make sure that your home looks great where people see it first. **Don’t use camera phones—use a professional photographer.** You want to draw buyers in to come see the home in person.

**If you get a lot of showings and no offers, that’s another indication that the home is overpriced.** In this case, people are using your house to sell another house and that’s not a situation you want to be in.

Interpreting the market and finding out the prefect price for a home is what my job is and I’m really good at it. If you have any questions for me about your home sale or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me na mail today. I look forward to hearing from you.
