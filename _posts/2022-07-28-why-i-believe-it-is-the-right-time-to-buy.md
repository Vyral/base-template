Is it still a good time to buy? Many people are wondering, so I studied the current market trends and predictions, and I believe that it is. Let me tell you why.&nbsp;

One question that many buyers are wondering is where will mortgage rates go? No one has a foolproof crystal ball to know for sure, but one thing that market experts do believe is worth mentioning is that **the lower rates during the pandemic were not the norm.**&nbsp;

This year rates have climbed 2% due to the Federal Reserveâ€™s response to rising inflation. If inflation continues to rise, mortgage rates will likely do the same. This will affect your buying power and how much you can afford. **That is why it is crucial to work with a team of professionals, so you have expert advice to make informed decisions.**&nbsp;

This decrease in affordability has decreased demand, but inventory has increased. Experts say that inventory growth will continue. More homes to choose from will be great if you are craving more options in your home search, but again, working with a professional is necessary to stay on top of what the inventory looks like in your market.&nbsp;

Another huge thing to mention is that there has been a record-breaking increase in home prices, and they are still expected to rise more, but at a more moderate rate. That is why it may make sense to buy now instead of waiting. Plus, once you buy a home, **the appreciation will increase the value of your investment.**&nbsp;
