What are a home’s four “L’s?”

Before we get to that, I’d like to go over something I often ask my buyers to think about. When I sit down with clients, I like to ask them what their “must-haves” and “would-be-nices” are. **Must-haves are non-negotiable items, like the number of bedrooms or bathrooms they want in a home.**

Would-be-nices are items like hardwood flooring, or other negotiable features.

This is where the four L’s I mentioned earlier come in. The four L’s of a home are features of a home that can’t be changed, which are:

**1. Lot.** This constitutes the yard or parcel of the house.

**2. Location.** This particular point is a very important aspect of real estate.

**3. Layout.** This refers to the floor plan. You can technically change this, but doing so is very expensive. If you’re spending a ton of money changing a home’s layout, you may as well just buy a different home.

**4. Light.** I’m not talking about chandeliers or other fixtures, I’m referring to the natural light that is let into the home. For example, a home on a wooded lot is going to tend to be very dark.

Other features like granite countertops, hardwood flooring, or a particular style of cabinets are much more easily changed than these four L’s.

While I will certainly take all of your specifications in mind when looking for your dream home, focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in choosing the right house.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
