Welcome to the latest episode of “Facebook Live Fridays.” This time, we’re answering a few common questions about selling your home during the holiday season.

**Are fall and winter good times to put your home on the market?**

Absolutely. Things have slowed down in our market a little bit, but buyers are still looking and inventory is still a little light. If you put your home on the market, it will catch the attention of serious buyers.

**Do the holidays make things harder for sellers?**

Perhaps, but your home can still be sold during the holidays. Like I said, the market does slow down a little bit this time of year, but any buyers who are, for instance, moving in from out of town will definitely look at your property. In fact, I bought my own house one week before Christmas.

**What are buyers typically like during the holiday season?**

If you give your home a nice holiday ambiance during showings, with music playing and cinnamon cooking and a fireplace going, that will help make buyers feel comfortable and warm and possibly more apt to make an offer.

**Which fall and winter months are the best to list in? Does that even matter?**

September and November are typically good months to put your home on the market, but if you stage your home correctly and price it competitively, any time is a good time to list it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
