If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to scuba dive in the ocean and explore a coral reef, underwater sculptures, and ancient shipwrecks, today’s video is for you. I recently spent a wonderful time at Sandals Resort in Grenada; I caught everything on film, so I’d love to give you a first-hand look at all the beautiful, natural environments we came across. **Before we go on this adventure together, though, let me fill you in on what’s going on in the Louisville real estate market.**

Sales are slowing a bit in our area and throughout the country. A recent survey found that only 35% of respondents believed now was a good time to buy. Additionally, buyer demand is at an 86 on a 0-100 scale, which is a decrease from last month’s 88 and the first decline since November. There are a few reasons for growing buyer fatigue, including price appreciation, low inventory, low mortgage rates, and homes that sell incredibly quickly and above list price.&nbsp;

**Inventory is still low, but we’ve recently seen a slight uptick in available homes.** This is likely due to sellers who are entering the market later, and it indicates we may be headed toward a more neutral market. Mortgage rates are also expected to remain between 3% and 3.5% throughout the next year, and homes are expected to appreciate anywhere from 6.6% to 10.6%. In the future, appreciation is expected to slow back down somewhere between 2022 and 2025.

Now, on to the underwater tour. **For your convenience, I’ve included timestamps of today’s video. Feel free to navigate to the section(s) you’re most interested in viewing:**
