I recently hosted a coaching webinar series titled “Real Estate Fundamentals.” I thought some of this information was really useful, and I wanted to make sure that you received it. **Here’s an outline of what was discussed, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the points that interest you the most:**

4:15- A quick walk-through of the series as a whole.

8:00- Why adding value to relationships via your database is key to growing your business.

11:00- An in-depth look at the Career Growth Initiative calculator and how you should be using it.

23:50- The four conversations you should have on your mind and in your life every single day.

26:00- How my team tracks these four conversations and uses them to our advantage.

27:30- My challenge for you today that should take no longer than 30 minutes.

29:20- The main takeaways you should have after watching this video.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about anything we discussed in the webinar above, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
