One of the things that have been on the rise in recent months is bedbugs. With the lifting of travel restrictions, these creepy crawlies are making a return. Thankfully, there are some steps that you can take to help protect yourself from bedbugs.

First, **be mindful of where you put your luggage.** You don’t want to place your bags on any surface that might be infested. Some people like to put their luggage in the tub—others like to store it on the table or dresser. The one thing that you must never do is to put your luggage or clothes on the bed or the chairs.

Second, you should check out a couple of areas of the room just to make sure. The easiest way to do this would be to pull the corners off the mattress and check the sheets and bottom surfaces. **You’re looking for tiny stains that appear to be little inkblots—**just like if you were to take a ballpoint pen and touch it to a white sheet. These are actually bloodstains, and they’re a sure sign of bedbugs.
