What exactly is included in the sale of a home?

Oftentimes, whenever buyers see that a home’s MLS description says it comes with a washer, dryer, refrigerator, ect., they assume that those items are included with the home when they buy it. That’s not true—that just means the seller is offering them as part of the sale. **If you want these items to be included in your purchase, you must specify that in your offer.** If you don’t, they won’t be included—no matter what it says in the home’s MLS description.

On the flip side, sellers commonly forget to exclude items like curtains and chandeliers from their sale. **If you forget to exclude these items, that means when the buyer writes their offer, they don’t have to specify that they want them included—they’ll be considered real property.**

This is why, on our team, we provide our sellers with a checklist of items so they can specify what they want included and excluded in their sale before we accept an offer.
