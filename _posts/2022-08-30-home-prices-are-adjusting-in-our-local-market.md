What happened to the Phoenix real estate market? I believe it’s best to answer that with the facts, so I’m here to share some critical market indicators and explain how they affect your buying and selling plans.&nbsp;

If we compare this month’s market to what it was at this time last year, we’ll find that inventory has increased by 155.7% while homes under contract dropped by 29.2%. On the other hand, the median monthly sales price is up by 11.4% at $450,000, which is a $30,000 drop since May. Additionally, the number of homes that have closed is down by 33%, and the median days before a house is accepted is 21 days. Our days of supply is 65. Lastly, around 28% of the entire MLS had to adjust their prices only a week before I recorded this video.

What does this all mean? **If you’re a seller, you need to hire a true professional who has the marketing and negotiation skills to help you win in this changing market**. For buyers, take advantage of this shift. Interest rates have dropped and are now around 5%, inventory is rising, and sellers are more open to concessions.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about this market or need help with your buying and selling plans, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I would love to be your real estate consultant\!&nbsp;
