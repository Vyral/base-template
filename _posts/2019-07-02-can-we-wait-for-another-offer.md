Welcome back to another segment of “What’s Working Now Tuesday at 2”\!&nbsp;

A few days back, one of my sellers received an all-cash offer above their asking price with a 14-day settlement and, much to my surprise, they asked me this question: **“Marjorie, can we wait for another offer?”** Let’s talk about whether this is a viable option. &nbsp;

In the case of this seller, their property went on the market on a Friday and they received the offer in question on Sunday afternoon. **It had a short home inspection contingency, was all-cash, and came with a 14-day settlement.**

We priced the property realistically and tactically so that we could attract multiple offers to it. The buyer who made the first offer was understandably afraid that someone else might swoop in, so they did a good job of putting their best forward and making their best offer.&nbsp;

Still, my seller was determined to wait for another offer. I warned them that if we waited, one of two things could happen: The buyer who made the offer may get anxious about the delay and suspect that we’re waiting for another offer. The second possibility was that another offer could come in and scare off our first buyer.&nbsp;

I ran through all the options with my client concerning their first offer—sign, counter, or reject. **My advice was to sign it,** and there were a couple of reasons why.&nbsp;

First, as I said before, the home hit the market on a Friday and we maximized its exposure all weekend long. We had constant traffic and showing after showing between Friday and Sunday, and I wasn’t receiving any inquiries about the property.&nbsp;

Monday came and still no phone calls, but here we had this golden offer. In the end, we received one additional offer, but it was actually below asking price. **Thankfully, I was able to work with my seller and the original buyer to strike a deal.&nbsp;**

We later learned that our buyer backed away from a previous offer they made on a different home because the seller made them wait.&nbsp;

The lesson here is if you have an offer that almost seems too good to be true, and you’re thinking about leaving your options open, think carefully about the potential risks posed by that decision. **The risks of letting it go are usually not that good.**&nbsp;
