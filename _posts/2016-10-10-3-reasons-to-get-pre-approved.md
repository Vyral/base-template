{% include youtube.html %}There are three reasons to get pre-approved for a mortgage before you shop for a home:

1. You'll know what you can afford. People will come to me wanting to look at homes in a certain price range and then proceed to get pre-approved. Many times, these buyers end up qualifying for more than they thought and have more options for buying a home. You won't have to cap yourself because you'll know what you can afford.
2. You won't know what interest rates will be until you lock them in. If you look for a home first and then get pre-approved, you won't have a good idea of what your payment is. You might find out that payments are more than you can afford on a monthly basis, and we have to reduce the purchase price. Interest affects more than just the price, so you want to lock in your rate before shopping.{% include pullquote.html %}
3. You can provide the seller with the pre-approval letter. This is huge if you find yourself up against other offers. If you don't have a pre-approval letter and the offer you're competing against does, the seller will most likely go with the offer with the pre-approval. Why? All the lender information is there to verify that the buyer has the necessary funds. Sometimes sellers who go under contract with buyers who aren't pre-approved will cancel the deal within a week when they find out about their pre-approval status.

Don't underestimate any of these three points about getting pre-approved for a loan before you look at homes. If you have any questions about the pre-approval process or you're thinking about buying a home in Sacramento, give us a call or send us an email. We'd be happy to help!
