<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I recently received some life-changing advice, and I want to relay it to all of you today.</em></p>

I recently shot a great new commercial with real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, who you might recognize from the hit television series “Shark Tank”, and while we were filming, she offered me some life-changing advice.&nbsp;

I’d like to share these words of wisdom with you today, but before that, I want to answer a question I hear all the time: “How can someone get on ‘Shark Tank’?” I think people assume that because I know Barbara, I’ll be able to get them on TV. This, unfortunately, isn’t the case, however, what I can do is let you know about an open casting event coming up on May 2 at the Jacob K Javits Center in New York City.&nbsp;

If you’re an entrepreneur looking to make headway with your business by appearing before the “sharks”, this is your chance to do so. You can learn more about this opportunity [on the ABC website.](https://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/open-call){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;

With that said, I’d like to move on to the advice I mentioned earlier. To paraphrase, Barbara told me: **“If you’re always grateful, you’ll always be successful.”**

This idea really resonated with me and hearing it gave me cause to reflect on a recent event in my life.&nbsp;

As you probably remember, I’m a runner. When I’m not helping people with their real estate needs, running is my second passion. You can imagine, therefore, how disappointed I became after learning that an injury I sustained during a recent marathon would prevent me from running until I recover.&nbsp;

After hearing Barbara’s advice, though, I began to consider my circumstances from a new perspective. I decided to focus on being grateful that I’ll be able to run again at all, rather than feeling upset about the fact that I can’t right now. **I’ve started approaching life with an attitude of gratitude, and I encourage each of you to do the same.** When you prioritize the good things in your life over the hardships you’re facing, even greater things will come.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
