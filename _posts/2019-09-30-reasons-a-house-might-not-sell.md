In the last 30 days, 304 homes failed to sell, even in our hot real estate market. Why does this happen? Usually, it’s because of the property’s location, price, condition, or marketing. And it isn’t always just one of these factors. Fortunately, our team has the skills and experience necessary to ensure this doesn’t happen to our clients. We spend over $100,000 each year helping sellers like you market their homes, and this is just part of the reason why homes listed with us sell more quickly and for more money than properties listed with any other team in Northwest Arkansas. It truly does matter who you list with. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
