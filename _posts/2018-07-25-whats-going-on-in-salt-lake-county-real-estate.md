I recently did an interview on Facebook Live, where I discussed the Salt Lake County real estate market and answered some common questions that people have been asking. **Here’s an outline of the discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the questions and answers that interest you most:**

0:30- What markets and price brackets are hot in Salt Lake County and what’s driving demand for homes in these areas?

2:45- What kinds of homes are not selling in the market right now?

4:13- What’s the median sale price in Salt Lake County?

4:55- How quickly are homes selling over asking price these days and what kind of terms are those deals selling with?

6:20- What’s the best place to get an accurate estimate of your home’s value? (Hint: It’s not Zillow)

I hope this conversation was informative to you. If you have any questions for me about the real estate market in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you.
