Welcome to real estate. The reality is that you’re in the relationship business. Success in your business depends on the number of relationships you have and the number of people in your database.&nbsp;

The more you have, the more opportunities you will get to help people buy and sell houses. Here are three ways that you can ensure you’re focusing on and growing your business through relationships:

**1\. Who do you already know?** Pull out your phone and start documenting everyone in your address book that you know and have a relationship with. An easy way to do this is by searching “Memory jogger exercise” online and doing one.

**2\. Who do you need to know?** Alternatively, who do you already know that you need to invest more time in, depending on that relationship? An example here is someone who has a lot of clout or charisma, or friends and family members who are great connectors and would love to help you succeed. They already know lots of people and are well respected.

**3\. How do you get to know more people?** This helps grow your database with new relationships. There are a lot of options here. I’d start by choosing areas that you’re already interested in and care about. For example, volunteering at a local nonprofit that’s near and dear to your heart or creating a business-to-business group or mastermind. What about calling local businesses to get to know them a bit better and find ways you can promote them. That’s another great way to deepen and grow relationships.

At the end of the day, it’s all about connecting and building relationships with more people, adding them to your database, and staying in touch. Show them that you care about them and that you’re a friend first. Then when they think about real estate, they'll think about you.

Let me know how you’re growing your relationships. If you have any other questions for me about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
