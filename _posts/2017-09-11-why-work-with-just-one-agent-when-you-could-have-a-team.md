  working with a team comes with benefits you simply can’t achieve while working
  with just one person.

Working with an experienced Realtor is always a great idea, but is there any benefit to working with someone who’s new to the business? Actually, yes. New agents have a lot of energy and enthusiasm.&nbsp;

However, if you’re going to work with a new agent, they must be part of a team. In a team environment, these new agents will have the help of other, more experienced agents.&nbsp;

This situation really brings you the best of both worlds. Experienced agents on the team can take care of negotiations and contracts, while the newer Realtor will provide a lot of vigor.&nbsp;

Just like medical professionals, **many Realtors have begun working more often in teams in order to provide a higher level of service**.&nbsp;

A real estate team will generally consist of several professionals who each play a different role. For example, the team leader will be the one who communicates directly with you and makes sure that everything is coordinated.

Newer Realtors will often take on roles like that of a showing agent, since this will help them really become immersed in a neighborhood.&nbsp;

However, once you start making offers you’ll generally work with someone on the team who is a little more experienced. Someone who specializes in contracts and negotiations will be a great asset in this process.&nbsp;

When working with a team, it’s common for you to work more closely with different agents at different points throughout the process. Try not to feel like you’re being handed off. The reason this happens is because **different agents have different skills that are best suited for various stages of the transaction**.&nbsp;

Instead of feeling as if you’re being passed around, remember that when you work with a team, you’re being granted the benefit of combined experience, skills, and resources.&nbsp;
