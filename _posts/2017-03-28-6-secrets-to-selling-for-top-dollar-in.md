I have six secrets to share with you that can help your home sale generate maximum price.

If you’re looking to sell your home in our spring market and are wondering how you can maximize your sale price, here are my six selling secrets:

**1. Don’t overprice the home.** Overpricing it is a poor strategy for making more money when you sell it. For example, last year in Spokane, 20% of the homes that entered the market failed to sell. That’s 1,800 homes in total. We know that the No. 1 reason a home doesn’t sell is pricing. Don’t be a part of that 20% and position your home to sell from the get-go.

**2. Clear your closet.** Storage is something every buyer is looking for in this market. Clear your closet as much as you can and then neatly organize whatever is left.

**3. Light it up.** New lighting in a new home ranks fairly high on most buyers’ priority lists. When showing your home, open the drapes, clean the windows, and replace any light bulbs where needed. Essentially, do all you can to ensure that your home shows brightly and cheerfully.

**4. Hire the right agent.** Working with a good agent will make you money. Hiring the wrong agent will cost you money. Hire someone who has marketing expertise and has systems and processes in place to ensure you have a successful transaction.

**5. The kitchen comes first.** In many cases, you’re not selling your home—you’re selling your kitchen. That’s how important your kitchen is. If you’re planning on spending money preparing your home for sale, start there. That will give you the biggest bang for your buck.

**6. First impressions are the only impression.** Buyers will make a value judgment about your house the moment they pull in front of it. Based on the curb appeal, they’ll decide to either go inside or drive away. Spend some time improving the curb appeal of your home. Take a minute and stand in front of your house and look at it from the eye of a buyer. Address any issues you need to fix to convey a great first impression. This could be the difference between selling and not selling your home for the price you want.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to sell your home, feel free to give me a call. In the meantime, make it a great day!
