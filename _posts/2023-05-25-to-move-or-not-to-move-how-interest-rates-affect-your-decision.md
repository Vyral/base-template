Today, let's address the elephant in the room: the low interest rates. It's a question that many people ask me—why would they give up their low interest rate of 2.75%, 2.875%, or 3.0% to make a move?&nbsp;

The answer is that it depends on your motivation and rationale for moving. Of course, interest rates are a factor that should be considered, but people move for different reasons. **Often, it's due to things that can't be changed in their current home, like the layout, location, lot size, or natural light.** If this is the case for you, then you may be looking to move for reasons independent of your interest rate.

However, I understand that the thought of trading a low interest rate for one that’s twice as high doesn’t sound great. **But it's important to note that people who bought during low interest rates paid more for their homes due to competitive bidding wars.** There are also creative programs available that can help, such as loan buy-down programs that offer reduced rates for the first few years. Many lenders also allow for free or low-cost refinancing if the rate goes down after buying with them.

Ultimately, money is a factor, but it may not be enough for many people if they need more space or a different location for life reasons. Rates also go up and down, so it's important to keep that in mind. My job isn't to convince you to move, but to be a resource for you when you need to make a change.&nbsp;
