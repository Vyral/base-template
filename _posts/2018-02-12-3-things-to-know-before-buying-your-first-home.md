Buying your first home is a very exciting process, but it can also be very stressful. Before you get started, there are three tips I’d like to share that can help prevent issues as you move forward.

1. **Know what you can afford.** Many first-time homebuyers only consider their mortgage when deciding on their budget. They forget about closing costs, taxes, insurance, and the ongoing maintenance that comes from owning a home. When you rent, you can call your landlord and ask to have maintenance done for you. But when you own a home, you are your own landlord, so these maintenance costs are your own responsibility.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
2. **Choose your lender wisely.** Choosing a lender isn’t something you should base solely on who offers the lowest interest rate. Work with a lending professional who is competent, will offer advice on improving your credit, and who will request and collect a list of documents they need to get you pre-approved. This documentation ensures your pre-approval is legitimate. You don’t want to go along with the process only to find out that your loan has been denied because your lender didn’t do the extra work up front. <br>
3. **Don’t overlook the details.** Many details go into buying a home and missing any of them could be a costly mistake. For example, I always advise buyers to get a professional inspection. This will help alert you to any potential issues before you seal the deal. Another thing to pay close attention to is the contract. Your agent should help you review and understand any of the fine print.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are ready to get started in your home search, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
