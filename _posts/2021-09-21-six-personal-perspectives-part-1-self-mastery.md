Today’s video marks the beginning of a six-part series on Six Personal Perspectives, a curriculum developed by Gary Keller that was designed around self-development. The first of the six personal perspectives is self-mastery. Let’s dive in\!

**Self-mastery starts with a process called KASH, which stands for “knowledge, attitude, skills, and habits.”** To be the master of anything, you have to have the right knowledge, attitude, and skills. Once your skills are established, you can develop long-lasting habits that will allow you to accomplish anything that you want.

Take marathon running as an example. If you want to master that, you have to be knowledgeable about running, as well as have an attitude conducive to accomplishing your goal. You also need to have the skills, which means you’d have to know how and where to run. Finally, you have to develop the habits over days, weeks, and months. Without actually committing to it regularly, there’s no chance you'll ever master it.

With that in mind, I implore you to reflect on what you’re trying to master within yourself. Is it a specific hobby? Is it leadership? Parenting? Your job? As you think it over, remember the KASH acronym.

If you have any questions about self-mastery, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email. I’d love to have a conversation with you.
