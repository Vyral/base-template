There are so many things you can do to get your home ready to sell, but I’m going to focus on the seven most important ones today:

**1\. Declutter the home.** Before I ever go see a home, I ask that it be decluttered. This means picking stuff up off the floor, cleaning off the shelves, getting rid of loose papers, etc. Pretend you’re having your floors or carpets clean and that’s a good starting point. Declutter your shelves, too.

**2\. Light bulbs.** Light bulbs matter, but a lot of homeowners don’t realize it. I went into a home recently that had four different colors of lightbulbs in the same bathroom. Make sure all of your lightbulbs are the same color and every bulb matches. 4k is the number that you’re looking for when it comes to the type of bulb you should get.

**3\. Clean the house.** I’m talking about a deep clean from top to bottom. If you need help getting anything ready that you can’t do yourself, we know vendors who can help you deep clean and we’d be happy to connect you. A clean home sells for far more money than a dirty one.

**4\. Make an appointment with a handyman.** Buyers will buy homes that are somewhat outdated at certain prices, but they won’t buy a problem. Just because you bought a problem in your home doesn’t mean the next buyer will want to. I’d be happy to connect you with a handyman that I know and trust.

**5\. Touch-up painting.** This is cheap and easy to do. Sometimes you may just need to re-paint a few walls. I can help you with this, too.

**6\. Staging your home.** Most often, staging just means moving furniture, but certain homes need more staging than others. Staging helps you get the most money for your home.

**7\. Depersonalize the home.** This doesn’t mean that you have to remove all of your family pictures—just don’t have a dozen of them in the same room. If you’ve got 15 bicycles in your garage, for example, it might be a good idea to put them in storage to make the garage look bigger.

If you have any questions for me about preparing your home for sale or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
