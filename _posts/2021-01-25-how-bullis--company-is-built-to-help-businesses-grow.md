<br>Today I’m honored to be joined by Kelly Bullis, CPA and president of Bullis & Company. He’s a second-generation leader as his father started the firm in 1965 and they’ve been able to help a ton of clients. They are a CPA firm that offers a lot of different services, and I sat down with Kelly recently to talk all about those services and much more.
