<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what the new normal looks like for homebuyers.</em></center>

<br>COVID-19 clearly hasn’t gone anywhere, so how are we continuing to help buyers get into new homes safely?&nbsp;

The first step that we advise is to **limit the number of people in your group when you’re out searching for homes**. For families, the easiest way to do this is to find a babysitter for the kids, or have another family member watch them while you tour homes.&nbsp;

Common sense is our greatest weapon in times of uncertainty. **Avoid touching anything while you tour a home**. Most sellers and seller’s agents are preparing their homes for showings such that you don’t have to even lift a finger for anything—lights will already be flipped on, and doors already opened. The adage of ‘look, but don’t touch’ has become more important than ever now.&nbsp;

Inside of the home, **we’ll still be practicing social distancing, using hand sanitizer upon entry and exit, and wearing masks**. We feel its best to err on the side of caution and to mitigate risks whenever possible for our clients.

The market is moving very fast, and there are a lot of buyers out there; it’s important to act quickly to compete, but it’s twice as important to act safely and smartly.&nbsp;
