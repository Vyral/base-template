Today I’d like to take a moment to wish each and every one of you a happy, safe, and healthy holiday season.

This time of year may be great for some, but it can be a very difficult time for others. I encourage you this year to spread some joy.

Consider greeting a stranger in the grocery store, at the bank, or anywhere else. **You can never be sure how much a small gesture might mean to someone who needs it**, since we never know what a person may be going through.

Speaking of support, we appreciate all of you who have made 2017 a record-breaking year for The Donaldson Team. Thank you to everyone who voted and made us the Top Real Estate Team for Northern Virginia for the third year in a row in the Virginia Living Magazine poll.

We’re so grateful to help you achieve your real estate goals each and every day. **My team and I look forward to connecting with you in the new year.**

As always, feel free to give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions about real estate. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
