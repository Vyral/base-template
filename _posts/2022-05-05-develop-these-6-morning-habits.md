If you can master your mornings, you can master your day. There's nothing worse than waking up in the morning and going right into your email and social media, feeling like your hair’s on fire for 12 hours because you’re so busy, and then coming home exhausted. So here are six steps to maximize your morning:

**1\. Silence.** After you wake up, take some time to focus on your breathing.

**2\. Affirmations.** This is a gratitude exercise. Think about all the things that you’re grateful for in your life.

**3\. Visualization.** Throughout the day, visualize the things you’re grateful for to keep you feeling positive.

**4\. Stretching and exercise.** Develop a light exercise routine.

**5\. Reading.** Spend time on personal growth or a business book that will help you level up an area of your life.

**6\. Journaling.** Write down the things that are important to you each morning and any ideas that came to mind.

This process can take about two hours, depending on your schedule and how long you exercise. If you develop these morning habits, I promise that you'll have a better day and a better life.&nbsp;
