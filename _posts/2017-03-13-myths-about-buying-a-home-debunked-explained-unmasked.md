***Here are the 2 myths that may be holding you back from buying.&nbsp;***

Fannie Mae’s article, “What Consumers (Don’t) Know About Mortgage Qualification Criteria,” revealed that “only 5 to 16 percent of respondents know the correct ranges for key mortgage qualification criteria.”

***Myth #1: “I Need a 20% Down Payment”&nbsp;***

Fannie Mae’s survey revealed that consumers overestimate the down payment funds needed &nbsp;to qualify for a home loan. According to the report, 76% of Americans either don’t know (40%) or are misinformed (36%) about the minimum down payment required.

Many believe that they need at least 20% down to buy their dream home, but many programs actually let buyers put down as little as 3%.
<br>On the right are the results of a Digital Risk survey of Millennials who recently purchased a home. As you can see, 64.2% were able to purchase their home by putting down less than 20%, with 43.8% putting down less than 10%!

***Myth #2: “I Need a 780 FICO&reg; Score or Higher to Buy”&nbsp;***

The survey revealed that 59% of Americans either don’t know (54%) or are misinformed (5%) about what FICO&reg; score is necessary to qualify.

Many Americans believe a ‘good’ credit score is 780 or higher. To help debunk this myth, let’s take a look at Ellie Mae’s latest Origination
<br>Insight Report, which focuses on recently closed (approved) loans. As you can see on the right, 54.7% of approved mortgages had a credit score of 600-749.

**Bottom Line**

Whether buying your first home or moving up to your dream home, knowing your options will make the mortgage process easier. Your dream home may already be within your reach!
