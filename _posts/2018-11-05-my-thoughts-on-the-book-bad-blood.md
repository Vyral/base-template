Once I started reading this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I first learned about **“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup”** after its author, John Carreyrou, spoke about it at an event. The subheading alone was enough to get me interested, and I’m glad I dove in. I’d like to share what I thought of the book today.

The focus of the story is on Theranos and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes. She began her business with the idea of changing the way blood testing is done. Everything added up to a great business venture with prestigious board members, partners such as Walgreens and Safeway, and hundreds of millions in investment. The firm was valued at $9 billion at its peak—what could go wrong?

**In spite of everything, the entire concept turned out to be a fraud.**

Bad Blood reminded me of another book, “Misbehaving” by Richard Thaler. Much like “Bad Blood”, this book explains what we think we know and why we think we know it is often wrong. Theranos seemed very credible, but all the information was based on something that was simply a lie.

**Because of situations like these where many of the investors did not get audited, people wonder how a 401(k) is affected.** During times of market volatility, we have to go back to what Thaler touches upon: What do we know, what do we think we know, and what do we think we understand?

We believe there are a number of questions you should have answered about 401(k)s. We can help you, and it’s as easy as reaching out to us to talk. We look forward to hearing from you.
