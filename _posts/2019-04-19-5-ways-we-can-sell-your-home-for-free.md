Today I’m going to talk about five different ways that we can sell your home for free. That’s right, we can sell your home in a number of different ways that result in you not having to pay any listing commission. **Here’s how we do it:**

**1\. Buy & Sell for Free Program.** If you are planning to upsize into a bigger home from a smaller one, we can waive our listing commission if you complete both transactions with us. We are only paid when you buy a home.

**2\. Smart Seller Program.** When you list a property with us, you always have the option to sell the property yourself and pay no commission. If you find a buyer on your own while we are selling your home, we won’t charge you any commission.

**3\. Auction Marketing Program.** With this program, we will sell your property auction-style. It’s a five-day online auction that will get your home multiple offers. With this program, the buyer ends up paying all of these commissions for you. To find out more about this specific program, go to [**www.ArizonaRealtyAuction.com.**](https://www.arizonarealtyauction.com/){: target="_blank"}

**4\. Sell to a cash investor.** If your home needs some repairs or a lot of work in general, this is a great option. We can connect you directly with an investor who will pay cash for your home and they will cover our fees, leaving you to pay no commission fees.

**5\. VIP Buyer Program.** Anytime you buy a property with us and you aren’t happy with it in the first two years for some reason, we will sell it for you for free. 

These are five ways we can sell your property for free. If you have any questions or want to learn more about any of these programs we offer, don’t hesitate to give me call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
