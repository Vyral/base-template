Did you know that tech trends have an influence on real estate? Some of them may surprise you.

 Virtual reality headsets play a part in real estate now with 3D videos that can be used for home tours. **You can use the headset to virtually walk through a house!** I’ve got friends across the country who are testing this now with clients. It looks like it might be a game changer for showings.

 Drone technology has also taken over the world in the last couple years. Now you have to have a pilot license for drones, but **there are companies around Roanoke that use drone videos.** This will change the way you see a property.

**One of the most intriguing trends we’re seeing is smart homes.** Personally I have the Nest thermostat, and I can control my house and my office temperatures from my phone. Video cameras have become much more popular in homes as well, which give you a real-time view of what’s happening during a showing or open house. You can also hear what you’re saying, so we need to be careful about what we do and say in a house.
