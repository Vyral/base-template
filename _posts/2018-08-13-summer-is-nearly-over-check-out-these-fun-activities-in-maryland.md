With Maryland schools starting right after Labor Day this year, the first weekend in September is the perfect opportunity to make even more summer memories in Maryland. I’ve compiled a list of some of our favorite local ideas to get you inspired for the season.

**1. Maryland State Fair (August 23-September 3)**. No other event provides so much food, fun, and family entertainment for so little. There are both tame and thrilling rides, classic and local foods, livestock, garden and home exhibits, thoroughbred racing, and even live national concerts featuring star entertainers like Smash Mouth, Chris Lane, and Jefferson Starship. Hit up this event through September 3 at the State Fairgrounds in Timonium.

**2. Maryland Week in Ocean City (August 26-September 9)****.** I love a good bargain, and Maryland Week in Ocean City means discounts. Some hotels are offering 15% to 20% discounts depending on the length of your stay. Others are paring discounted room rates with gift certificates to restaurants or other amenities in the area. Use this as an opportunity to enjoy the last vestiges of summer and pack in a little more fun in the OC sun.

**3. National Hard Crab Derby and Fair (August 27-September 2).** This is a unique crab-themed festival at Summer’s Cove in Crisfield that features crab races, crab cooking and picking contests, carnival rides, arts and crafts, live entertainment, beauty pageants, a parade, and fireworks shows. Remember to bring your mallets!

**4. Rhythms & Reels (August 31-September 1).** Join Baltimore City Recreation and Parks Department for the third season of Rhythms & Reels, a free series of music and movies in our local recreation areas. On Friday, August 31, you can bring the whole family to see “Wreck-It Ralph” at the rec center in Cartonsville. On Saturday, September 1, you can watch “Despicable Me 3” at Lakeland Park in South Baltimore. Come hungry, because there’s free popcorn.

**5. Sunset Paddle on the Middle Branch (Friday, August 31 from 7-9 p.m.).** If you prefer nature to the movies, this event is for you. You can explore our waterways on a guided tour with the Recreation and Parks Department. You’re likely to see fish, crabs, and maybe even a great blue heron. There will be 10 canoes and 10 kayaks, so RSVP early to reserve your spot in a boat. There will be small fee for both residents and non-residents, but everything you need is provided for paddling.

**6. Wa****terfront Wellness Series (Saturday and Sunday mornings from 7-9 a.m.).** Go get healthy at the harbor with free local fitness classes, featuring yoga, boot camp, dance, and even just plain running.
