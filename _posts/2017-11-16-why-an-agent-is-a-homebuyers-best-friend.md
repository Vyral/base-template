A lot of people out there think that when the time comes for them to buy a home, they can go out and do everything on their own. In reality, hiring an agent is the only way you’ll be able to go through the transaction step by step with limited hassle and worry.

**Working with an agent who is involved (like all the agents on our team) is a huge plus**. We can help you write up a wishlist with everything that you want in a home. Then we can help you look at properties that match the items on that list. Not only do we have access to the entire local MLS, we often have our own inventory of off-market properties as well.&nbsp;

In addition to off-market properties, we also have all the information you need about various neighborhoods and schools. We’ll be able to answer any of your questions faster than you can type them into Google.&nbsp;

Buying a home on your own is one thing, but buying an FSBO (For Sale By Owner) on your own has even more potentially disastrous consequences. There are pages and pages of disclosures that we use with FSBOs to protect our buyers. **Without that knowledge, things could go south quickly**.

The best part about hiring an agent to help you buy a home is that it won’t cost you a thing. We don’t charge transaction fees and we don’t charge you for having us represent you. Why wouldn’t you want to hire someone who is ready, willing, and able to negotiate the best terms possible on your real estate purchase contract and will coordinate everything while they’re at it?

Before you choose an agent to hire, however, make sure you ask them questions like, “How many homes have you sold in the last year?” and “How long have you been working in real estate?”

If you have any questions about buying a home or you need our help at all with any real estate struggles, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
