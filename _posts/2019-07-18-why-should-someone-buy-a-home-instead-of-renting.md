When you buy a home, you pay it off on a monthly basis and build equity into the property. If you’re renting, you’re not doing that. By buying, the longer you stay in the home, the more equity you’ll have and the better off you’ll be in the long run. It’s kind of a forced savings account. Another reason to buy a home is to help build your community and enjoy time with your family and friends.Studies show that owning a home not only increases your net worth, but it also helps keep families together.&nbsp;
