Recently, we’ve had a shortage of inventory. This has led to a lot of bidding wars due to the hot competition over our currently limited supply. &nbsp;

**One option buyers are turning to in these competitive times is asking the help of parents and other family members.**

With the help of a family member, many young buyers are able to beat out the competition by putting forward cash offers. Of course, the mortgage can always be refinanced after closing, but this is a great way to secure a deal.

If you’re unable to pay cash, **you can also write an offer with fewer contingencies and a strong down payment.** This is another thing that can make your offer stand out in today’s hot market.

I hope keeping these tips in mind will help you as you enter our low-inventory, high-demand market.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
