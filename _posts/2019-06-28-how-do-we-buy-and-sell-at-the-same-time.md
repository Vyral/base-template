Buying and selling a home at the same time can be tough, but there are plenty of solutions to help make it easier.

In order to buy and sell a home at the same time, the one thing you need is a game plan. If you need to sell your current home first to be able to make a purchase, **you’re probably going to end up making a contingent offer.**

New construction might be a good solution if you’re in this situation. Most builders in the area will work with a contingent offer if you’re represented by a reputable real estate agent.

**If you’re looking for a resale property, on the other hand, the contingent offer might be your only move.** If that’s the case, there are some things you can do to make this contingent offer more enticing to a seller.&nbsp;

Making your home a “coming soon” listing is a good way to do this. **It gets more attention on your home before it even hits the market.** When you do find your perfect home to buy, we can show the seller that your home is 100% ready to list and all you need is seven to 10 days to accept an offer.
