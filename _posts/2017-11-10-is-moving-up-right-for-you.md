Welcome back to our rightsizing series. Today, we’ll be talking about moving up.

When you’re buying your first home, or any home, there are many important factors to consider. You’ll need to think about **whether the neighborhood and school district are good, but also about your daily commute from this new home.**

These are all important things to consider, but timing can also become a major issue for anyone who’s moving up.

Having a professional help you through this process will be key. This is especially the case if you need to list your current property, as well. In this situation, **the ideal outcome would be for you to close on your current and new property at the same time.**

Moving up will cost you if it goes wrong. That’s why my team and I want to make sure you do it right. **We’ve got a great opportunity for you to learn more at our upcoming event.** We hope you’ll join us at rightsizing seminar at Arrowhead Country Club. You can RSVP and [**find all of the details here.**](http://www.nateshomes.com/VIP-Seminar){: target="_blank"}
