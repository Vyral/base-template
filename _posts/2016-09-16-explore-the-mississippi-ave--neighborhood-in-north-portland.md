{% include youtube.html %}Mississippi Avenue is a north Portland neighborhood that runs just east of the I-5 between Skidmore and Freemont. This neighborhood is a cozy pocket of Portland near the PCC Cascade campus and allows easy access to the interstate and the MAX.

My favorite eatery in Mississippi Ave is Prost! Stop by Prost! for a great German meal with beer and sausage. The best thing to order for lunch is the German Pretzel Sandwich with German potato salad and a Franziskaner beer.

Of course, for a true taste of Portland cuisine, you should visit Homegrown Smoker Vegan BBQ. I recommend the Slowsmomofo Sandwich with Mac-No-Cheese. It’s delicious!

For a true Portland recycling experience, hop into the Rebuilding Center. You can find a variety of affordable building materials and things you didn’t even know you needed.

The average home price on Mississippi Avenue is $450,000. This neighborhood features an eclectic combination of home styles including new homes, quaint bungalows, old Portland craftsman homes, and Victorians. In fact, a gorgeous Victorian home that was built in 1896 sold this May for $700,000. The 3,000 square foot home has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a carriage house that was converted into an additional dwelling. This is just one innovative way that Portland is answering the call for more housing.
