I recently had the honor of guest speaking on the "[Agent Power Huddle](https://bixel1.net/v1/t/c/d3a8eece-d588-4244-a250-93406c00cf12/gm%3A84632113-1083-49d6-a81f-b3b1d0dd5254/Multiple%20Recipients/?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F424573031031011=){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}" show. Every time I'm asked to do this stuff I think, "really? You want ME?"

It's a funny feeling to consider that maybe I, as a little old Realtor in St. George, Utah, have some type of wisdom to offer the real estate world, but they felt I did\!

We've now served over 1500 families and the average Larkin Group agent will close 36.6 transactions in 2021. That's about 5.3 times as many deals as the average local Realtor closes. We have MULTIPLE Agents earning $200 - $300k\! Clearly we're doing something right\!

The focus in our office is ALWAYS on working "by design", vs. "drifting" (yuck, the most common practice of active Agents in the world), or even being "driven", (an oft-reverred quality that ultimately isn't alway great\!)

Check out my conversation wtih Agent Power Huddle host, top producing team owner, and one of the best guys I know, Jesse Zagorsky.&nbsp;

We'd love to hear what you picked up from the show, and what did we miss?&nbsp;

If you'd like guidance on building a business by design, we should be talking\!&nbsp;[larkin@gostgeorge.com](mailto:larkin@gostgeorge.com){: target="_blank"}, or shoot me a text at 435-862-8467\!
