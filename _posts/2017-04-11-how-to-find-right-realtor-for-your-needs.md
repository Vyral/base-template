Your house is probably your biggest asset, so how do you pick the right real estate agent when it comes time to sell it? Ask these questions.

When the time comes to choose your home, how do you choose the right Realtor?

It’s one of the most important decisions you’ll make since your home is one of your biggest assets. Choosing the wrong agent could cost you thousands—or even tens of thousands—of dollars.

**You want an agent who will market your home aggressively to get it sold quickly and for top dollar.** That’s why the first question you should ask a potential agent you hire is how much their marketing budget is.

How much do they spend per month advertising homes? Next, you want to ask what their marketing strategy is, step by step. Thirdly, ask about their history: how long they've been in real estate, how many homes they’ve sold, and their close-to-sold ratio.

The next thing you’ll want to know is if the agent actually has buyers. **One of the many benefits of our team is that we have more than 14,000 buyers in our database that we reach out to.**

Many times, homeowners choose their friends to sell their house, and unfortunately, I’ve seen many relationships severed because real estate and friendship don’t always mix.

If you have any questions about finding the right Realtor or you’re thinking about buying or selling in the Brainerd Lakes area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you!
