Today I would like to guide you through a few tips that will help you stage for a quick home showing.

**The first step is to open up all of the blinds.** I recommend tilting your blinds at an angle and opening your curtains to optimize the amount of natural light you let into your home. Also, turn off all the lights in your home to enhance this effect.

**Next, make the home smell nice.** You can easily achieve this by using plug-in air fresheners. Vanilla is a popular scent. As an alternative to air fresheners, you can also rub a small amount of vanilla extract directly onto light bulbs throughout your home.

Baking some fresh cookies is another way to improve your home’s atmosphere during showings. Baked goods not only smell good, but they can also serve as a gift for your potential buyers. I recommend leaving cookies on a plate with a welcoming note.

**Finally, make sure you clear off and wipe down all countertops.** Little touches will go a long way in making your home more appealing.
