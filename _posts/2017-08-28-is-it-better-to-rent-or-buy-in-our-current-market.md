Should you rent or buy a home in our current market?

How long you plan on living in the area is a very important factor in making this decision. If you’re looking to relocate soon because of—say—a job transfer, it might be a good idea to stay liquid and keep renting until that transfer happens.

Buying a home, though, comes with many important benefits that renting doesn’t offer. If your income is at a level where you’re able to write off the interest rate you pay and the taxes you pay, you should consider homeownership to take advantage of the tax benefits that come along with it. With a mortgage, you can enjoy having the same fixed payment for 15 to 30 years instead of dealing with a rent payment that could change from month to month.

Buying a home also brings with it flexibility and freedom. You can paint the interior the way you want, for instance, or change the appliances if you feel like it.

Lastly, buying a home is a good way to build equity. As this market continues to grow, you’ll gain equity in your property which could someday be used to finance your children’s college education.

If you or anyone you know has any questions about whether they should rent or buy in our market or is looking to sell their current home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
