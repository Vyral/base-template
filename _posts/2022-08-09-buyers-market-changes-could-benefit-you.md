This is the question I’ve been hearing a lot lately: “Is this the right time to jump back into the market to buy?” I think the answer is yes.&nbsp;

If you were trying to buy a house six months to a year ago, you probably faced a lot of competing offers. Many people also paid around $20,000 over the listing price back then, which is not something everyone can swing.

**Today, inventory has grown, so there are more choices.** Plus, a house could be on the market for around 30 days, which is much longer than recent numbers. As a result of these changes, houses aren't selling as high—buyers today could save $30,000 with the recent price decreases. That is a big reason to get back in the game.&nbsp;

These reasons lead me to believe&nbsp;**it is a great time to buy.** If you have questions about buying or selling, reach out through a phone call or email. I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
