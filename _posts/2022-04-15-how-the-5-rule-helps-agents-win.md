According to the Social Security Administration, if you take any 100 people at the start of their working careers and follow them until they reach retirement, only one will be financially healthy. Four will be financially secure, five will continue working because they have to, 36 will be dead, and 54 will be broke and dependent on family, friends, and the government to take care of them.

**Only 5% of us will be successful in creating a life of freedom, while the other 95% will continue to struggle for all their lives**.
