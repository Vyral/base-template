Contrary to what you may think, listing your home during the holidays is actually a very smart idea. Here are seven reasons why.

While most people think that there are fewer buyers looking for homes during the holiday season, there are a few reasons why this time of the year is a great time to list your home. Here are my top seven reasons:

1. **Buyers out looking for homes during the holidays usually have an impending reason to move.** Because there will be less competition on the market from other home sellers, there will be a larger number of buyers who are serious about getting into a home quickly.

2. **Buyers are more emotional during the holidays.** Buyers want to be able to come in and see themselves in your home when it comes time for next year’s holiday.

3. **Houses show better during the holidays.** Your house will look better with holiday décor and buyers love to see this.

4. **Buyers have more time to look at homes.** Because it’s pretty common to take a few weeks off during the holidays, buyers will be able to take some time to make more prudent, rational decisions about purchasing a home.

5. **Some buyers have to buy a home before the end of the year or before tax season ends**. For a lot of people, this is a financial decision that they make under the guidance of their CPA.

6. **Some buyers need to relocate before January.** Because many new jobs begin in January, some buyers will need to be sure that they have a place to live and are settled in by November and December so that they can start work in January.

7. **As a seller, you won’t have to move during the holidays.** A good agent will be able to arrange a situation in which you close during December and then extend your occupancy in the house or get you a rent-back until you’re ready to move in January or sometimes even as late as February.

Don’t be tricked into thinking that buyers are only around during the spring or summer; lower inventory and less competition make the holidays a great to list your home. If you have the flexibility to be able to do this, give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to point you in the right direction!
