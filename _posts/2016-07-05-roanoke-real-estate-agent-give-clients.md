Giving gifts is a great way to show clients how much you value them. I wanted to share some of my favorite ideas with you today. **Clients appreciate anything of value that you give as a gift with heartfelt sincerity.**

 We always send a handwritten card to every single client. It’s been a game-changer for us. We also send a handwritten card to every agent we deal with now, and we’ve also started giving a gift card to every agent. The way we see it, we worked a deal with them, and our goal in life is to work a deal with every agent and have everybody come out of it happy. **We give every client a gift card as well.**

The other thing we do for our clients is give them a Cutco knife. We made an investment of about $20,000 into Cutco last year, and we give one to each client because we value the relationship, and **we want to give them something in return that provides value, and stays with them.** Some give a gift basket, for example, but that just doesn’t stay with you.

Likewise, a gift card to a restaurant doesn’t last. **Right now, if someone buys or sells a house with us, we’re giving them a cruise.** They're spending a lot of money, and it gives them a chance at a vacation after the big transaction. Some can afford vacations and some can’t so we like to give that opportunity to everyone.

 If you’re looking for more ideas for gifts, please feel free to give me a call. I’d love to help.
