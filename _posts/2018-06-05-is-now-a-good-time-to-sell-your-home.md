Is it a good time to sell?

That’s the million-dollar question I was asked on my latest appearance on “Real Talk San Diego.”

It’s always a good time to sell if you need to sell. As real estate agents, we’ll often get called into an appointment for someone who has to sell. For example, I recently listed a property in Escondido for a seller who was moving to be closer to family.

However, there are different reasons people sell homes, so the answer to this question is **it depends on your objectives and what you’re hoping to accomplish.** As a homeowner, if you’re getting older and you have some equity on the table and you want to move that equity into something safer, it’s a great time to do that.

If you’re an investor and you want to take some money off the table, you could do a 1031 exchange. I’ve handled a couple of those transactions in the past year, and they both did very well. One of the sellers used the equity of their rental property to purchase a single-family home. The other seller sold their rental and parlayed that into two other separate homes.

It’s our job as agents to understand what your needs are as a seller and keep your best interests at heart because selling a property can be a conduit to a variety of other life options. **If we know what’s important to you and what you’re hoping to achieve, we can use our knowledge and expertise to help you achieve all of your goals.**

It was my pleasure to sit down once again with “Real Talk San Diego.” As always, if you have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
