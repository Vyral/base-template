Recently I was featured on Fox News’ “Consumer Corner” segment to discuss what’s going on in today’s Central Florida real estate market.

The market is hot across the board—but the extent of the heat really does depend on the zip code. Orlando, specifically, is the No. 1 city in America for first-time homebuyers according to CNN.

Several communities have very active markets, including: Yalaha and Howey-in-the-Hills in Lake County and Bithlo, Conway, and Orlo Vista in Orange County.

There’s a tremendous amount of growth in these areas. **Lake Nona has also become a new hot spot for Orlando real estate.**

But what about specific zip codes? 32833 (Wedgefield, Cape Orlando Estates) has a median price of $326,000—up 36% from this time last year. Properties are also flying off the market in that ZIP code, spending an average of just 44 days on market.

Conway properties, in the 32812 ZIP code, are also selling higher than they were last year. With a 13% increase from 2016, median home prices are now $227,000. Additionally, the 32811 and 32812 zip codes are great for anyone searching for entry-level homes.

As the saying goes: **“It’s all about location, location, location.”** So what do first-time homebuyers need to know before entering this market?

First of all, get a solid grip on your finances and speak to a real estate professional before you start looking. The market is very competitive right now, so your financing needs to be in order before you find a home you’re interested in. Submitting an offer right away is critical.

Even Consumer Corner Host Danielle Knox, who has bought eight homes, was surprised by just how competitive the market was when she first moved here to Central Florida.

If you’re a buyer, don’t be discouraged. There is a lot of competition in our market but there’s also a lot of opportunity.

Interest rates are still very low. Working with the right agent with the right strategies will bring you access to off-market deals. This is actually one of the perks of working with us. We strive to get you great deals. In fact, **we guarantee on paper that you’ll save $10,000 on your home or I’ll personally write you a check for $1,000.**

The circumstances for sellers, though, are a different story. Right now is absolutely one of the best times to list your home on the market. Because of lower interest rates and high competition, buyers will be willing to spend more—meaning you’ll get more for your home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
