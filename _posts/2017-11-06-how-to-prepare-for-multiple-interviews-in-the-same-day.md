When you’re a candidate that’s going in for a full day of interviews with a company, it can be daunting to have to talk to so many different people. **You want to sound as fresh in the end as you do in the beginning, but that can be tough.**

One thing I advise our candidates to do is to simply write down some specific questions for the people they’re interviewing with on different pieces of paper. Write down different, specific questions for each person.

However, you should also make sure that you ask a few of the same questions in every interview. By asking a bunch of different people in the company the same questions, you’ll get a better idea of how the company operates and communicates internally with the answers you’re given.

There’s nothing worse than making it through to the last interview of the day only to freeze up when they ask if you have any other questions. By creating these lists, you won’t have to pick through your brain or fumble over your words. **The questions will be right there with you and you can get the answers.**

I hope this helps. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
