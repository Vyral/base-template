Today I’m here to introduce you to a great Wallingford business. We may have shot the video three years ago, but we’re excited as ever to talk about Dino’s Modern Barbershop.

**What sets Dino’s apart is their customer service.**Dino is a good friend of mine and I know how committed he is to giving his clients the full package. Not just a great haircut or a shave, but a conversation, a cup of coffee, and a smile as well. &nbsp;

Dino grew up in Wallingford and after working with his father for 20 years cutting hair in North Haven, he decided it was time for him to strike out on his own.

**Although Dino’s has a great modern, simplistic look, they do have one special relic from the past.** The chairs have been in their family since 1971 and add a nice touch of class to the space.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
