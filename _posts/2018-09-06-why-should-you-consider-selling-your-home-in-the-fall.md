Sometimes it pays to go against the crowd. The real estate market is definitely at a peak during the spring and summer, but going against this trend and listing your home in the fall can have some great benefits:<br><br>**1. Buyers are more serious.** During the spring and summer, many buyers are more curious than actually committed to purchasing a property. On the other hand, buyers in the fall tend to be more serious. Many have been searching throughout the summer and have not found their perfect home yet. Others are simply forced to look for a new home because of a new job, a work relocation, or because they want to complete their move ahead of the holidays. In other words, fall buyers make up in dedication for what they might lack in numbers.

However, homes that are not sold by the end of the summer are often delisted. Otherwise, they start to draw less interest because of the time they have spent on the market. If you list in the fall, you have the benefit of standing out, as well as facing less competition than during the "hotter" seasons.<br><br>**3. It's easier to move up.** If you're looking to buy a new home and also sell your current one, then the fall market may offer the best opportunity to do so. You will enter the market with confidence and without stress, while many sellers who have been unsuccessful in selling their homes during the summer will be more eager to sell during this time. This can lead to very flexible negotiations that will work in your favor.<br><br>If you have any questions about why the fall is such an opportune time for you to sell or about the home selling process in general, donâ€™t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
