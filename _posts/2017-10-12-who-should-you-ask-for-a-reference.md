Today I’m going to talk about references—the appropriate time to ask for references, and who to ask for a reference.

References are a vital step in securing a new role. It gives prospective employers a chance to get insight into your background, your successes and shortcomings in different areas, and how you addressed those in the past.<br><br>**The best time to ask for references is when you’re near the end of a search process.** You may have gone through several interviews and are expecting an offer here shortly. You want to reach out to the references you have listed and give them a heads up that they may get a call from either a recruiter, HR, or a hiring authority. **Give them the authority to give transparent feedback about you and your character.**

**The best person to ask to be listed as your reference would be your most recent supervisor.** As a new hiring authority, they really want to hear from a previous supervisor about the best way to manage you, how you excelled, how you acclimated yourself to a previous company, as well as your shortcomings.

**If you worked in teams before and had co-workers whom you knew and trusted, those would also be a great reference for you.** This would give prospective employers insight on how you worked in a team environment

Lastly, if you’re new to the workforce and you haven’t had a lot of work experience but have recently graduated, **a professor would be an excellent person to reference.**They can share how you performed within their class and how you fit into various projects you may have done.
