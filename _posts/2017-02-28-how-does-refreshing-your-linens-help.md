In order to sell your home faster and for more money, make sure you take care of one simple thing: refreshing the linens.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

If you are thinking of selling your home, I recommend that you refresh your linens. Why?

**The simple reason is that old linens do not show well.** If you have an old, worn bedspread that has a burned spot from an old ironing accident, buyers will think that you can’t take care of your home.

In fact, I walked into a house the other day where the drapes matched the wallpaper, which matched the bedspread, which matched the throw rugs. The entire room looked like one big ivy vine because every surface was covered with the same print.

**You need to have classy, clean, fresh linens in your home**. If you don’t want to get rid of your old, comfortable bedspread, simply put the new one on top of it when you prepare to sell your home. Doing so will position your house to sell faster and for more money.

You want people to feel like they could live in your house. They need to be comfortable in your house and every room needs to be fresh and clean.

If you have any other questions about staging your home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
