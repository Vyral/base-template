Which is the best investment: a new home or an existing home? If you’ve been thinking of buying a home, you may be asking yourself this question. Today, I’d like to give you my opinion.&nbsp;

First of all, the answer may vary depending on where you plan on buying. When buying in a newer neighborhood, existing homes can sometimes be a better buy.&nbsp;

These homes are still current but tend to be cheaper than a new home. New homes do provide you with the option to pick and choose items you like, but this can cause you to go over budget if you aren’t careful.&nbsp;

**If you are planning on buying a new home, be very cautious when choosing between your options.**

So, which is a better buy? Ultimately, the answer depends on your wants and needs. The right choice depends on what is important to you.&nbsp;

But, what about the sellers’ side of things? Which will bring more money: a nearly-new home or an older one?&nbsp;

Again, this depends on the neighborhood. **Existing homes in highly sought-after neighborhoods will be very popular among buyers.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
