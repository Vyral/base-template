I was recently a guest on “Smarter San Diego” to talk about a gem of a property that we have on the market in Carlsbad. **This property actually just went pending, but we wanted you to get a closer look at how we prepare and promote great homes like this.**

The home was built in the late 1970s, but the entire thing has been renovated. The beautifully renovated kitchen boasts brand-new everything. You’ve got space for kids, you’ve got space to entertain, and a gorgeous, large master bathroom. **There’s a lot of room for storage in this 21,000 sq ft. property.**

All of the windows have been replaced with high-efficiency windows and the brand-new roof has a 50-year warranty on it. It’s also in one of the best school districts in Orange County.

Appearing on shows like “Smarter San Diego” is just one of the ways we promote our properties to thousands of potential homebuyers. If you have any questions for us or you’d like to know what we can do to get your home under contract as quickly as we did for this one, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
