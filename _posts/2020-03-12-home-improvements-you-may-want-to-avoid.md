Are you thinking of putting your home on the market? Making some upgrades is a great way to boost its value and make it more sellable, but not all upgrades are created equal. In fact, some improvements won’t increase your home’s value, and today I have an article from The Balance to share with you that details six such “improvements.” You can check out the article from The Balance in its entirety [here.](https://www.thebalance.com/things-dont-increase-home-value-4048933){: target="_blank"} If you have any real estate questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
