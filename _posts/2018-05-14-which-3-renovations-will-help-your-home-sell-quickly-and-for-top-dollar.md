Which renovations can you make to your home that will both improve its value and help it sell for top dollar? Focus on these three key areas:

**1. Kitchen**. The kitchen is the No. 1 feature of any home—80% of all houses sell because of their kitchen. Quartz countertops are very popular nowadays, so that could be a good start to giving your kitchen an updated look with a contemporary design.

**2. Flooring**. Tile flooring (especially plank tile flooring) is very “in” right now, so that will also help your home sell very quickly.

**3. Fixtures**. Modern, contemporary fixtures will make your home look beautiful and more appealing to buyers.

If you’re interested in making any of these renovations, we’d be happy to refer you to one of our excellent vendors.
