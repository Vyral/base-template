In a fantastic market like the one we’re in right now, why would someone need the help of a listing agent to sell their home? Actually, the truth is that a lot more goes into listing a home than simply sticking a sign in the yard and waiting for buyers to flock in.

In the average real estate transaction, there are usually about 50 people involved in getting the deal from contract to close. **Inspectors, appraisers, Realtors, and a number of other professionals all play a role in making sure things go smoothly**.

With that in mind, it’s no wonder why trying to take on all of the work alone is a poor choice. When you forgo the help of a professional agent, you’re doing more work and earning less money.

**When you work with our team, we’ll have your home cleaned, staged, and professionally photographed—all to make sure you see the best results possible for your listing**. We also use a number of advertising tools in order to attract maximum exposure. All in all, listing alone is no replacement for selling under the guidance of a professional agent.
