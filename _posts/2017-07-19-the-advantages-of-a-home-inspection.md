Every buyer should have a home inspection done on the home they plan to purchase. However, not all inspectors are created the same. You need to know that you are dealing with a reputable inspector, so we have some tips to share today to help you do just that.

First, let’s talk about how you should go about finding a home inspector. Your best resource is going to be the real estate agent or team you are working with. They should have a short list of inspectors that they have worked with before who they like and trust that they can provide you. **We always give our clients at least three different names of inspectors so they can have options and figure out which is best for them.**

The inspector you choose should be licensed, first and foremost. To be able to ask for repairs from the seller at a later date, the inspection must be done by a licensed inspector. We also recommend that you choose an inspector that has errors and omissions insurance. This is a type of insurance that covers inspectors in case there was a defect in the home that they missed during their inspection. **This doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.**

The inspection will be completed during the window of time after the home goes under contract called the due diligence period. If there are any specific repairs that need to be addressed, this gives you the opportunity to do that and renegotiate the deal. Oftentimes, the price can be adjusted as well. **In some rare cases, you may want to eliminate the contract**. You can do that.

We always recommend a home inspection for any buyer. It doesn’t make sense to skip it. If you have any questions for us or need a recommendation for a good home inspector in Savannah, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
