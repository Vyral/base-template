Staging and preparing your home the right way are more important than ever, and most home sellers know this. However, things are a little bit different this time of year.

When you sell your house, how much staging and preparation work should be done?

In this day and age with HGTV, staging is more important than it was even eight to 10 years ago. However, **we have a very neat opportunity for you if you're thinking about selling early this year.**

Our inventory is still lower than it has been for the past few years. So while staging is important, if you're planning on selling before March, there's a chance you can get by with a little less staging than we'd need later in the year when inventory is higher.

If you're worried about closing while it's cold out, remember that if you put your house on the market now, you probably won't close until late March, early April, or even the beginning of May.

If you have any questions about staging or preparing your home to sell, we can give you some tips and ideas and tell you what your competition is doing. We can also let you know what buyers like to see and, most importantly, help you avoid spending money in areas that won't help sell your home or make you more money. Just give us a call or send us an email. We're excited for a fantastic year in 2017!
