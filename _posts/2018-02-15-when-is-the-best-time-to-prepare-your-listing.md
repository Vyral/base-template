Today, we’ll be continuing our series on things to do when preparing to sell your home. The tip I’d like to share this time is: Just do it!

There are so many things in life that we tend to put off for another day instead of taking care of them as soon as possible. I’m not going to lie to you. **Putting your home on the market certainly isn’t the most fun experience. However, it is rewarding.**

Let’s take the example of selling a car for $10,000. Most people in this situation will spend $200 on getting the car detailed, having its tires filled or replaced, or getting it waxed. But when these same people sell a $200,000, they hesitate to spend even $500 on these kinds of upgrades and finishing touches.

However, little changes can really add up and pay off. **Before you bring in a Realtor, start clearing out the clutter and doing everything else you can to prepare your home for the market.**

Right before you’re ready to list, hire professional cleaners to make your home really shine. The time to start preparing your home for the market is today.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
