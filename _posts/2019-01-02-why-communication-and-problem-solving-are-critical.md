As we’ve said before, the agents who are listing-focused and have a strategy for taking listings are dominating the market right now. Today we’re going to talk about a few things that are very critical in preparation for your listing presentation: **communication and problem-solving.**

**To me, these are the two most critical skills you can learn whether you’re a real estate agent or not.** If you can be a great communicator and problem solver, you have the ability to make a huge impact on the world and the people around you. Here’s an outline of the discussion we had, with timestamps, so you can skip around to the part(s) that interest you the most:

2:30- An intro to communication and problem solving.

4:00- The business of relationships.

5:15- Tips for building rapport and being aware.

6:30- The 5-step process of communication and how it relates to receiving a present.

11:50- How to use communication strategies to solve problems in your business and in your life in general.

21:20- The “Three P” approach to negotiation.

23:00- How my daughter used the “Three P” approach to come up with an agreement when she wanted to make an Instagram account.

25:50- Additional negotiation tips to help you have success.

26:30- How rapport comes in handy when dealing with “Chicken Littles.”

29:00- Final thoughts.

Thanks for joining us yet again. Next time, we’ll talk about some closing strategies. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about this topic or about your business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
