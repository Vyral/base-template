Do you feel like your talents as a real estate agent are being underutilized? How much better do you think you could perform if you were negotiating 30-40 offers per week?  How about if you went on 10-15 listing presentations every week as well? I have an opportunity for you to do exactly this.

I am currently hiring a full-time licensed Realtor as an apprentice to work side by side with me to teach you the ins and outs of this business. This isn't your typical part-time apprenticeship. It's a full time position with salary and opportunities for bonuses

As an apprentice your responsibilities will include going on listing presentations with me and on my behalf. You will also be negotiating and writing offers for my clients, as well as prospecting and doing lead generations every  day. I'm not looking for a typical agent, however. The person who gets this job will need to have a lot of ambition. Somebody that is organized and carries themselves like a true professional.

This apprenticeship will last anywhere between 6 and 12 months, after which I will transition you to a full time sales position within my team. This is an opportunity you will not want to miss out on. The last two people we had in this position did between 4 and 5 million dollars in sales their first year!

If you are looking to take your career to the next level, give me a call at  (440)974-0404. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!
