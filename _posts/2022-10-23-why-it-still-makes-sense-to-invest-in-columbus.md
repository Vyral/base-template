Our real estate market is changing; is it still a good idea to invest in property in the Columbus area?&nbsp;

In our opinion, absolutely. **Columbus is still one of the top 15 hottest real estate markets in the country, yet prices remain relatively affordable.** On top of that, Ohio is a very landlord-friendly state, unlike places like California.&nbsp;

The only negative is that repair costs might be a little high. While labor costs are evening out, materials are still scarce. However, it is definitely worth it to purchase in our area. **Rents have increased by 20% to 25% in the last few years,** and thereâ€™s no reason to believe those prices are going down.&nbsp;

If you want to avoid high rents by purchasing a home, or if you want to buy a fantastic investment property, call or email us. We are always willing to help\!
