<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can make 2019 your best year yet, even if the market is proving to be volatile.</em></p>

Today we’ll be talking about the latest market outlook and go over how we can make 2019 your best year yet.

The stock market is volatile, the Fed is raising interest rates, and there’s a lot of uncertainty floating around. Is the real estate market good, though? It depends on your area, whether you’re buying or selling, the price point you’re in, and many other factors. **Reach out to me and we can figure out what will work best in your situation.**

My biggest concern, though, **is that many people are moving down south.** People are retiring or their kids are going off to college, so they figure now’s a good time to downsize and move to a new area. This is only going to accelerate over the next few years.

While the market is uncertain, there’s one thing we can be in control of: **that 2019 will be our best year yet.** I’ve been able to mentor someone recently, and I believe it’s helping me just as much as it is him. Most of life is used finding your purpose, and I think one of the biggest purposes we have is helping others. I’m all about helping build others up.&nbsp;

In David Goggins’ book, “Can’t Hurt Me,” he tells a story about an instructor who taught two trainees how to open a clogged airway. Two days later in a skydiving incident, the instructor’s airway became clogged and he was unable to breathe. **He was then saved by the two people he had trained just two days prior.**

Through mentoring, sometimes the life you’re saving is your own. Life can be a struggle for many, but it depends on how you look at it; I see it as a blessing. If you’re struggling, I’d love to sit down with you and lend a hand. I know I certainly wouldn’t be where I am now without the wonderful mentors I’ve had in my life.

If you’d like to talk, have any questions, or need more information, please reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
