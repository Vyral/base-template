If you’re in the process of selling your home, there are eight things you can do to ensure that it’s prepared for an inspection:

**1\. Repair any damage to the driveway and sidewalks.** You can purchase silicone or caulking seal inexpensively at most home goods stores. If the task is bigger than that, we can recommend a concrete worker who can help you out.<br>**2\. Recaulk around the exterior doors and windows.**<br>**3\. Have your HVAC system serviced at least once per year.** Be sure to save the receipts, as well\!<br>**4\. Replace cracked windows.** You’d be surprised at how inexpensive this can be\!<br>**5\. Have the fireplace and chimney inspected.**<br>**6\. Fix any leaking faucets.<br>7\. Check and change any light bulbs that are burnt out/broken.<br>8\. Change the batteries in your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.**
