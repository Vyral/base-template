One of the most common issues that sellers encounter is a request for repairs from the buyer. This can be a frustrating experience, but it's important to know how to handle it properly. Today, we'll discuss your options for how to deal with this.&nbsp;

One of the best ways to avoid surprises when selling your home is to **have inspections done before listing it**. This way, you can address any issues and make necessary repairs before buyers even come to see the property. This approach will help you negotiate better and avoid major complications when you’re already in escrow.&nbsp;

It's important to remember that **buyers have the right to inspect the property and ask for repairs or a credit**. Although your knee-jerk reaction may be to say no, it's best to work with your real estate agent to evaluate your options.

In a normal real estate market, it's common for buyers to request repairs or a credit. This is particularly true when the buyer has spent a lot of money on inspections and discovered major issues. Also, remember that a repair request is not a demand for you to do everything on the list, but rather a starting point for negotiations.&nbsp;

Once you receive a request for repairs, **you need to work with your agent to decide on the best course of action**. In some cases, a credit may be the better option as it allows the buyer to take care of the repairs themselves after closing. In other cases, it may make more sense to complete the repairs before closing, which may be beneficial if you have a tight timeline or if the buyer has requested repairs that you're confident will increase the value of your home.&nbsp;

You need to understand the current real estate market when dealing with this issue. There may be more or less competition, which can impact power in negotiations. Your agent can provide this data so you can make informed decisions.&nbsp;

Selling your home can be a stressful experience, but it doesn't have to be. When you work with a knowledgeable and experienced real estate agent, you can navigate the process with confidence.
