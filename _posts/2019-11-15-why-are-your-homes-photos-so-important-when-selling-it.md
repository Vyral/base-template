It’s a great time to get your home ready for a 2020 sale. We love helping people prepare their homes months in advance so we can market them in advance. We take listings that aren’t being sold by other Realtors, put our magic touch on them, and sell them extremely quickly.&nbsp;

We recently put a property on the market that had previously failed to sell and got it under contract in just two days. Professional photography is so important.

Today I’m excited to show you our work in action by presenting some of our best listing photos compared to the photos that they had previously used.

**Here’s an outline of the video, with timestamps, so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:**

**0:40-** How we improved the Rydal Road listing’s exterior photographs<br>**2:45-** How we improved the Rydal Road listing’s interior photographs<br>**4:55-** How we improved our Acorn Lane listing’s exterior photographs<br>**6:30-** How we improved the Acorn Lane listing’s interior photographs<br>**8:50-** How we improved our Harbor Lane listing’s exterior photos<br>**9:50-** How we helped transform the Harbor Lane listing’s interior photos

<br>As you can see, photography matters so much when you’re selling your home. **With each of the homes in this video, we took a failed listing and turned it into a success with good photos, a bit of elbow grease, and some minor repairs.** This led to even higher sale prices.

If you have any questions for us about selling your home or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
