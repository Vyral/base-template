I’m out here today looking at building lots in a pocket subdivision just north of Eagle. One of my favorite things to do is helping homebuyers find lots to build their custom dream home. **I have a few clients who are looking for acreage lots and I’m scouting out the area.**

As you can see in the video above, there’s plenty of open space in this area. You can see what it looks like in the summer [here.](http://iplayerhd.com/player/GrandRidge7760U)

**Whether you’re looking for an acreage, a waterfront lot, or something on a golf course, I can help you find the perfect spot.** I’m happy to do the research for you.

If you have any questions for me about building, buying, or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
