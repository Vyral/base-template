Now is a great time to move up into a new home. If you have a lot of equity, you can actually secure a lower monthly payment.

A lot of people want to move up into a bigger, nicer house in a better neighborhood. Maybe they want a great view, like a golf course or a lake. It can be difficult to make the numbers work. However, with the latest market increase, if you’ve been in your home for a few years you may have more equity than you think.

**In fact, you might have enough equity to be able to get that new home in a nicer area while keeping the same monthly payment.** If you sell your home with our advice and take the equity you’ve earned to apply as a down payment on your new home, you will see a ton of savings.

You’ll be able to get a lower interest rate, and if you’re able to put more than 20% down with your equity, you won’t have to pay mortgage insurance either. **Your payment will drop and it might even cost you less than what you are paying right now.**

The window of opportunity to take advantage is closing. If you have any questions or want to know more about how you can move up easily in this market, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
