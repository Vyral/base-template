Today marks the final installment into our series on the seven components of a business plan. This time, we are going to talk about processes and procedures.

All business plans must incorporate a client relationship management system, also called a CRM. There are many CRMs available, such as Top Producer, Firepoint, BoomTown, or TigerLead, that you can choose from. Personally, we use Firepoint, because it can take your business take you from a small group to a large team.

You also need to figure out your marketing plan. **Where do you get your leads from?** It doesn’t matter if you choose Zillow, Realtor.com, or pay-per-click leads—you still have to map out your systems. Many people jump into using Facebook advertising. However, this is actually the least profitable lead source for agents, simply because it is so common and easy to use.

After your CRM is established, &nbsp;start reaching out to the people in the database. Set up a system that will tell you how often to call your past clients, your friends and family, and your hot, warm, and cold buyers.

If you have any additional questions about this, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
