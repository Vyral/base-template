Every real estate expert knows that you must provide the Information About Brokerage Services (IABS) form to prospective clients upon the first substantive communication, but are there any exceptions to this requirement? Trekâ€™s Legal Counsel has actually identified three scenarios in which you are not required to provide this form: When the transaction contemplated is a residential lease, and there is no sale transaction to be contemplated to be part of the relationship with a specific client; when the licensee is aware that the client is already in a representation agreement with another licensee; or when the communication occurs at an open house. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
