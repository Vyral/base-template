If you’ve considered selling your home in 2017, I have four urgent reasons you should get off the fence and onto the market.

If you’ve been thinking about selling your house, I have four reasons why you should absolutely do it in 2017.

The first reason you should sell your home right now is that **mortgage rates are still low.** Today, rates are at around 4%, but the NAR, Zillow, and other publications have stated that interest rates will probably climb to about 5% by the end of the year. With interest rates currently low, buyers can afford more house, which puts you in a better position to sell your home.

Second, **inventory is low and buyer demand is high.** This combination of supply and demand provokes multiple offers on homes, which is great news for the seller as multiple offers result in top dollar for their home.

Third, **home prices have gone up.** Over the last year, the NAR stated that homes prices rose by 6.8%. High home prices combined with low inventory creates a perfect storm for sellers.

Lastly, **the job market is improving nationwide,** which means the economy is improving. This in turn is causing people to feel more comfortable making bigger purchases such as cars and homes.

If you have any questions about the four reasons you should sell your home in 2017 or have any other real estate-related questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
