When I work with buyers who are on the fence and not sure if they’re going to purchase a home this year or next, I usually explain the cost of waiting and the impact that rising interest rates and prices could have on their mortgage.

**Today, a $300,000 mortgage at a 4% interest rate will give you a monthly payment of $1,432.25.** Homes are expected to appreciate 4.8% in the next year, and Freddie Mac predicts a rise in interest rates of nearly 1% by the end of the year.

This means that if you were to wait until 2019 and rates went up to 4.9%, you’d have to get a mortgage for $312,600 and your monthly payment would be $1,659.05. **That’s an extra $226.90 that you have to pay each month for the next 15 or 30 years.**

The bottom line is that if you’re financially ready to make a move and buy a home, do it now and save money. If you have any questions or need some guidance on this important financial decision, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
