{% include youtube.html %}Recently, we sold a house for Bill Carroll of KFI talk radio. Bill has been a great client of ours and has been talking about us for a long time on KFI. The thing that Bill says he likes most about us is our system.

"I love their system. Their team guarantees to sell your home on a certain date on an agreed-upon price and if they don't, they'll buy it from you. So of course, when it's time to sell our house, I had to call the Brad Korb Team," Bill said.

Bill had sold homes in the past, but they had always taken weeks, even months to sell. We are happy to report that once we got a hold of Bill's listing, we sold the home after being on the market for only 4 days. We got multiple offers and offers above appraisal value.

If you have any questions about how we sell homes, or any other real estate question, please let us know. We would be glad to answer them.
