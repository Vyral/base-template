Today, I’d like to address a common misconception regarding our pet policy here at Hawaii Pacific Property Ventures. Contrary to popular belief, we do allow pets on our properties unless there are specific restrictions imposed by the association governing the building. If such restrictions exist, both the homeowner and our company must adhere to them.

You might be wondering about exceptions, particularly for emotional support and service animals. **Rest assured, with proper documentation, these exceptions are indeed permitted.**

We understand that each pet is unique, and so is their impact on our properties. Therefore, the deposit amount required for pets varies based on factors such as size and breed. It’s worth noting that this deposit is fully refundable, provided there is no damage to the property during the tenant’s occupancy.

If you have any further questions or concerns about our pet policy, please feel free to reach out to us at (808) 445-9223. We’re here to assist you, always.
