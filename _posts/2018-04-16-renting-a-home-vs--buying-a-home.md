Is it better to rent a home or buy a home?

There are some people out there who have not yet purchased a home because they fear the obligation of paying a mortgage.

However, whether you rent or own a home, you’re paying someone’s mortgage. It’s better for you to pay off your own mortgage rather than someone else’s. We talk to many clients who are paying thousands of dollars toward someone else’s mortgage and they are not benefitting at all.

More often than not, we hear that our clients can’t afford a mortgage. If that’s the case for you, when was the last time you checked with a mortgage lender? Most often, it comes back that you can afford a mortgage because you don’t need as much money as you thought.

One of the main benefits of owning a home vs. renting is that you’re paying your own mortgage. By doing that, you’re investing in yourself and your future.

The best way to start the buying process is to contact a buyer specialist who can connect you to a great mortgage lender. Give us a call or send us an email if you are interested in buying a home or if you have any other questions. We would be happy to help you!
