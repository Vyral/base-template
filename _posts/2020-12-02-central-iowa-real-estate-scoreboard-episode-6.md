<p style="text-align: center;"><em>On this episode, we’re focusing on multiple-offer strategies for sellers.</em></p>

When you are a home seller who is receiving multiple offers, it’s very common for your agent to reach back out to buyers to ask for their highest and best offer by a certain time frame. I try a different approach because I’m not the biggest fan of the sense of finality conveyed by this strategy. **The approach I take involves going back to the buyers, letting them know that we have a multiple-offer situation, and asking if they’d like to make any adjustments to their offer before proceeding.&nbsp;**

With this method, we can counter any of the offers that come in. It doesn't just have to be the highest-priced offer; I think that’s something a lot of people get caught up on. **A lot of agents don’t explain to their clients that price isn’t the only thing that should be considered;** terms like the earnest money deposit or inspection period are very important, too.

If you have any questions for me about how to choose the best offer or compete against multiple buyers in this market, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
