According to Remodeling Magazine, big-ticket remodeling activity is enjoying record economic conditions and is expected to rise 5.1% this year alone. While remodeling is great for the economy as well as a home's equity, problems can arise when owners take on the tasks themselves without the proper training and preparation. Of course, some of these problems can be avoided, which is why I have made a list of the three biggest mistakes homeowners can make while renovating.

**1. Overestimating your skill.** Tiling may look easy, but attempting to tile your whole bathroom without so much as taking a class or at least watching a YouTube video could be a recipe for disaster. Chances are you'll either end up calling a professional to come finish the job, or rip it out and start all over again. To avoid making this costly mistake, take on something small first to see if you're any good at it and, most importantly, if you have the patience to finish it with details all the way to the end. If not, it may be a good idea to get a quote from a professional who can get the job finished in a timely manner.

**2. Underestimating your budget.** It is a universal truth that no one ever puts enough money aside for the renovation. The last thing you want to do is have a problem that arises where you'll have to change your plans or stop mid-renovation to find more money. Experts say to avoid this you should create your budget amount for the renovation and then add an additional 20% or more; if you think it will cost about $10,000 for your renovation, save $15,000 just in case.

**3. Minimizing the timeline.** Homeowners doing their own renovations can greatly underestimate the amount of time needed to make the changes mostly because of their inexperience. It is can also be shaped by individual needs; just because you can have two weekends to redo your kitchen before your in-laws arrive doesn't mean that it can be finished in that time frame. There could be unknown issues that slow you down.
