Now is a great time to list your home—here are three reasons why.

Today we brought on three agents who want to give you some great tips about why now is the time to list your home.

First, remember that **inventory is very low**. As Katarina Scheutte points out, this past July, there were only 3,600 homes on the market, whereas last year, there were 6,000\! Since the market is so competitive, we’re constantly searching for new homes for our buyers.

Second, be sure to get your home ready for the market. **If your home looks in good condition, it will sell quickly.** With a background in staging and designing, Tess Bartmann can help you make sure your paint colors are right, your kitchen looks updated, and she can give you advice on how to coordinate your decor to make your home look its very best.

Lastly, understand that **interest rates are historically low**, meaning that you can buy more house for your money.&nbsp;

If you get your home in excellent condition and list it with Healthy Realty, we’ll help you get it sold quickly. And again, we are in need of new listings, so if you’ve been thinking about selling your home, contact our team today. We would love to help you.
