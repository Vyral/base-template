In 2017, the Jeff Cook Cares Program was able to do some amazing things that I want to share with you today. I also want to tell you about our plans for 2018.

In 2017, we were able to donate $100,000 back to the community thanks to your support of our real estate company. 1% of our revenue is donated; we call it the 1% For Good. **This 1% goes directly to the Jeff Cook Cares Program, which goes out and services all the people in the community.**

Here are a few things we did in 2017:&nbsp;

* Helped rescue 257 dogs from the Charleston Animal Society and paid for their adoption fees.
* Sent people on mission trips.&nbsp;
* Supported Little League teams.&nbsp;
* Got yearbooks for high schools.
* Supported high school baseball teams

We then finished off the year by donating $10,000 to the Shawn Jenkins MUSC Children’s hospital.

How does this affect you?

Whenever you refer our real estate company or purchase a home with us, 1% of our revenue gets donated back to the community. Thanks to your business and referrals, you helped the Jeff Cook Cares Program donate around $105,000 back to our community. **Thank you so much for your help, love, and support.**

We have a few great plans on how to give back in 2018, including down payments for veterans and teachers as well as teaming up with State Housing Heroes, Habitat for Humanity, and the Charleston Animal Society.

**We really want to focus on helping kids and children—that’s where our heart is in this.** So, we are calling out to Little League teams, high school football and baseball teams, and more. If we are able to support you, we would be happy to donate to you and your cause.

You can send an email directly to [sponsorships@jeffcookrealestate.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,112,111,110,115,111,114,115,104,105,112,115,64,106,101,102,102,99,111,111,107,114,101,97,108,101,115,116,97,116,101,46,99,111,109))). The committee will meet and decide if we are able to help you out.

Again, we wouldn’t be able to do this without your referrals and your business. If you have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
