**Thereâ€™s a duality in our housing market right now.** In my 20 years of experience, I can attest that it is both a buyer's market and a seller's market. Let me explain what I mean by that.&nbsp;

Currently, some buyers are highly motivated to purchase, feeling like they missed out on the last market due to high prices and waived contingencies, like repairs and appraisals. It was truly a crazy market! However, with the market and inventory being calmer than last year around mid-2022, deals are happening again and buyers are getting more concessions and negotiation powers.

For buyers, this does not mean every property is a deal, as it depends on the home and its pricing, but for those who felt like they missed their chance, there is now a lot of promise. For sellers, it may seem like a tough time, but in reality, it's a great opportunity to get your house on the market. **February is a good time to start as spring and summer are typically the hottest times in our market.** By being ahead of the rush and getting your house positioned and prepped so it looks its best, you can attract more buyers.

If you are a buyer or seller and would like to discuss strategy, please feel free to call or email me. I'd be happy to help with any questions, big or small.&nbsp;
