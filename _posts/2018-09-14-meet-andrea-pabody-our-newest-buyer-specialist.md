As the newest member of Team Lally, the journey that led Andrea Pabody to us started on the other side of the real estate transaction.

Andrea is an avid Dave Ramsey fan, and she and her husband were actually referred to us back in 2015 when we helped them buy their home. She found it to be an amazing experience, both in dealing with our team and the purchase itself.

What motivated her to join us? Andrea often thought that she would love to get into real estate, but she never considered it to be a real possibility while she was serving in the Army as a human resources officer. Now that she’s a veteran, she has the opportunity to pursue her dreams, and she thought it only natural to join the same team that provided her with such a great experience when she was a client.

Andrea works as one of our buyer specialists, and what she enjoys most about working on a team is being able to work with people who have a depth of knowledge that they’re willing to share. In her words, we have a spirit of community and service and we work together very well.

Moving forward, she’s excited about this new venture and looks forward to helping you with buying, selling, or investing in real estate.

If you’d like to know more about Andrea or message her on our website, you can check out her full profile here. You can also reach her by phone at (808) 386-8770.

If there’s anything else we can help you with, don’t hesitate to call or email us anytime. We’d love to help you.

Thanks and aloha!
