I’m coming to you today from Toyland in Bentonville, Arkansas to discuss a few reasons why selling your home during the holiday season can be a great idea.

In the spirit of the season, I also want to bring you a list of some great things to do around this time of year here in Northwest Arkansas. But first, let’s talk real estate.

So, what are the top reasons to sell your home during the holidays?

1. **Reduced inventory.** There is a common misconception that the fall and winter markets aren’t a good time to list. As a result, there is significantly less inventory on the market during the holiday season. This translates to less competition for you.
2. **Buyers are more serious.** During this time of year, the buyers who are still looking on the market are truly committed to finding a home. So, the holidays are a great opportunity to capture serious buyers.
3. **Financial incentives.&nbsp;**Some buyers may be looking to purchase a home by the end of the fiscal year because of certain financial opportunities. This will drive further interest in your property.

These aren’t the only reasons to sell this season, though. There are actually about seven more that my team and I would love to share with you. To find out what they are, email us at [info@limbirdteam.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(105,110,102,111,64,108,105,109,98,105,114,100,116,101,97,109,46,99,111,109))).
