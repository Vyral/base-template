How do you get your nights and weekends back as a real estate agent? This is a crucial question because real estate is a tough business when you’re busy, and it’s even more difficult to serve your clients at a deep level and have your own life at the same time. You also deserve to have some time of your own. So there’s a three-step process to getting your nights and weekends back:&nbsp;

**1\. Create an expectation-setting document.** Review this document at each new client appointment. Ensure it sets your office hours and some boundaries around when you’ll communicate with them.

**2\. Leverage someone who handles the administrative processes.** We have a transaction coordination department on our team just for that purpose.

**3\. Have a showing agent.** This agent will help show your buyer clients homes so that you can check out and be with your family on some nights and weekends. We also have a showing agent concierge on our team.

If you want a more in-depth copy of our three-step process so you can implement it into your business, just type “3-step process” in the comments below or private message me the same phrase, and I’ll follow up with you.
