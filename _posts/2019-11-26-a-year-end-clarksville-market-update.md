We haven’t brought you a market update in a while, so today I wanted to share the latest real estate statistics with you that show how the Clarksville market is doing.

**Our market is still active, and we didn’t see the slowdown in September that we typically do.** In fact, we listed a property last week that received six offers and sold in one weekend for $15,000 more than our list price.

Right now, we have about 890 homes for sale on the market. That’s down from the 1,016 we saw at this time last year. Closed sales are up slightly from last year as well.&nbsp;

The average sale price here in Clarksville is up to $209,500, up about 8% from what we had at this time last year. It’s a great time for sellers to be on the market. **This doesn’t mean that buyers can’t win too, but you need to be an informed buyer.** We’d be happy to help you get there.

The hottest price range is between $150,000 and $200,000. That’s almost 29% of our market, but there are only 89 homes for sale right now in this price range. The $100,000 to $150,000 and the $200,000 to $250,000 are still doing great as well. **If homes in any of these price ranges are prepared and priced properly, they are selling very quickly.**

Before I go, I wanted to remind you about our upcoming client event on Saturday, December 14 at 8:00 a.m. at Regal Clarksville Cinema. **It’s first come, first serve, so make sure you send in your RSVP to [umeka@valeriehunterkelly.com](mailto:umeka@valeriehunterkelly.com) if you haven’t already\!**

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
