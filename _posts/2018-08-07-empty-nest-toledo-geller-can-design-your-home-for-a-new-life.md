I’m here today at the Toledo Geller interior design studio with Jessica and Virginia, who are with me to discuss a big topic—**empty nesting**. They have been in business together for 12 years, and their projects run the gamut from full house renovations, apartment renovations, and everything in between.

Many of their clients are parents whose children have now moved away, leaving strong emotions and extra house space in their place. Together, Jessica and Virginia will discuss what topics and questions about empty nesting come up most frequently and how they help those going through this phase of their life.

For myself, almost 65% of my clients are empty-nesters, and the first question almost all of them have for me is simply, “How?” How can an empty-nester adjust to their new life and use their home to the fullest?<br><br>For your convenience, I have included timestamps below so that you can skip around to the portions of the conversation that interest you most.
