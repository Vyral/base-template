As a buyer, it’s really important that you understand your rights to all of your home inspection options, even if you are buying an “as-is” property.&nbsp;

If the seller has already done the majority of inspections, such as a pest inspection, roof inspection, or even the general home inspection, that will save you a little bit of money. If they have that available, you should absolutely take advantage of that.&nbsp;

If they don’t, then you have what’s called a contingency period to get all of your inspections done. **In our market, the contingency period is typically about 17 days.&nbsp;**

We always recommend that you order the general home inspection. You should also get a pest inspection to make sure there aren’t any active infestations and, of course, the roof inspection.

Once you get those inspections done, make sure you go over the results with your real estate agent so that you understand what’s happening.

In a competitive market, you may get counteroffers prior to an inspection asking that you buy the home “as-is.” However, it’s important to understand that **you should never waive your right to an inspection**. Even when you take an as-is counteroffer, you still have the right to review those inspections.

In our market, there really is no such thing as “as-is.” If there is something in the inspection report that frightens you to the point where you don’t want to move forward, you have the right to ask the seller if they will do those repairs. Buyers often don’t understand this, so they get scared, walk away from the contract, and lose out on really big opportunities.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, when you’re in a contract, there is going to be negotiation. Your agent is there to represent you and make sure that you move forward confident about your purchase and that you know what your options are.&nbsp;

One of the things we highly recommend **is that you show up to your home inspection**. You don't have to go to the pest inspection or the roof inspection. Just wait for those reports to come back and then review them with your agent.&nbsp;
