Here’s what to consider when deciding how to put your home on the market.

If you decide to put your house on the market, should you fix it up or sell it as a fixer-upper? To answer this question, consider who you’re selling the home to and where it’s located. Many times, if buyers hear the term ‘fixer-upper,’ they’ll think they’re getting a bargain. **A fixer-upper can work if you’re in a premium location and inventory is low,** but if you’re not, buyers may come in at a very low price. You might also attract investors who are looking to fix and flip, which also means you won’t get the maximum value from the property.

If you fix up your home before listing, such as by redoing the kitchen or bathroom, you can enhance the property’s value to ensure you get as much from your sale as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns about selling your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
