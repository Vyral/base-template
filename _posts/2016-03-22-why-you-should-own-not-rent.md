{% include youtube.html %}Today, we’ll address why it’s better to own rather than rent in Northern Virginia.

The reality is, you have to live somewhere. You’re either submitting a monthly payment to a landlord or paying off a mortgage every month. It’s far better to pay off your own mortgage than someone else’s!

A mortgage allows a tax deduction, and that savings is huge for you! Whenever I help a first-time home buyer, they’re always shocked and delighted to see the tax savings by deducting mortgage interest. It’s incredibly rewarding.
