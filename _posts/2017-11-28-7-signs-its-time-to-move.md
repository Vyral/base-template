Over the years, we’ve become experts at identifying the trends that cause people to move. Here are the seven most common life changes that let you know you’re a candidate for an address change as well:

**1. The 7-year itch**. The average consumer moves homes every seven years.

**2. You are living below your means**. Quite often when we get a promotion or raise, we want our environment to reflect that. Renovations often aren’t worth the money, so buying a bigger or better house is a great option.

**3. You have children that have recently left home**. This signals that it’s time to downsize.&nbsp;

**4. You’re expecting children**. This signals it’s time to upgrade to a larger space.

**5. You’re getting married**. It’s often better for the new relationship when you can start off fresh in a new home instead of trying to move into one of the spouse’s old homes that will never quite be your own.

**6. You’re getting divorced**. The process moves along much quicker after any shared dwelling is sold and each party gets their own home.

**7. You have a long commute**. If you’re driving 45 minutes each way to work, that’s 1.5 hours every day and 1.5 months every year. That’s a lot of time to spend on unnecessary travel.
