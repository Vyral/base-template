I recently had the opportunity to speak with Mitch Katkus of M.K Movers about his moving business.

Mitch’s father used to own a truck-rental company, and people would often ask him if there was anyone who could help load and unload. Mitch and his friend volunteered for the job when they were still in high school, heading to work after classes finished for the day. This was the beginning of Mitch’s career in the moving industry as this after-school job evolved into a business.

Moving into or out of a home can be stressful, but thanks to his many years of experience, **Mitch is full of good tips to keep in mind when undergoing the task.**

He recommends you always get an estimate before hiring movers; though doing it over the phone can work, an in-person estimate works better and shows the movers what they’ll be dealing with. It makes a difference in cost, especially when a client says they have 50 boxes when, in reality, it’s more like 200.

**Mitch loves his town and loves to provide a helpful service to the community.** He enjoys seeing the many ways that St. Charles has improved and grown over the years in regard to dining, entertainment, and things for people of all ages to do.

M.K Movers are located in St. Charles but are willing to travel anywhere in the state of Illinois. If you’d like to contact M.K Movers or learn more, visit them at **[https://www.mkmover.com/](https://www.mkmover.com/)**.
