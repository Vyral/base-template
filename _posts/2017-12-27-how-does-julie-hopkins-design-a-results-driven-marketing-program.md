Julie Hopkins has achieved enormous success in her real estate business, but how does she design a results-driven marketing program for that business?

Julie entered the real estate field with a considerable background working with Fortune 500 companies. With her MBA and prior sales and marketing experience, **she used that background to drive her business by establishing a brand and being true to that brand.**

It also helps that Julie loves the resort community.

“I was fortunate to grow up in a Colorado resort community and then live in this resort community my whole life,” she says. “And just believing it and having all my marketing centered around that, and understanding my target audience, and trying to sell the resort community through all my communications that sell my business.”

Julie is very good at incorporating all the vendors that support her team in her marketing. Since she loves Park City and how it’s constantly evolving, whenever she sees someone new or a longtime resident starting a business, **she tries to support them with her own business and build a partnership.**

“Everyone in Park city has been really responsive to that,” she says. “I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.”

Fellow KW Park City agent Niki Thomas supports those marketing efforts by handling a lot of the back-end work and delivering and packaging of those marketing items. There are many details to this business and a lot of moving parts when it comes to coordinating with clients and coordinating marketing initiatives, and Niki manages many of those back-end moving parts.

**Working at Keller Williams has also helped Julie because it’s given her a certain autonomy to set her brand.** For example, she works with a designer she’s known for 30 years and previously worked with in corporate America. Working with that designer has helped her continually come up with fun ideas every year.

Julie’s marketing is delivering great results for her, and I want to thank her and Niki for joining me today.
