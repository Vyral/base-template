<br>Today, I wanted to discuss the Zillow estimates (or Zestimates) that people have recently been receiving in their email inboxes.

But, the estimates Zillow has been sending out to homeowners are greatly exaggerated in most cases.

In fact, **I personally received an email from Zillow with a Zestimate that was $100,000 off from my home’s true value.**

I also have been working with a client recently who received an estimate from Zillow that was $50,000 off. You need to be extremely careful about trusting the information Zillow is sending out.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, I’d love to talk. I work this market every single day, **so I can examine your property and give you a real estimate of what your home is truly worth.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
