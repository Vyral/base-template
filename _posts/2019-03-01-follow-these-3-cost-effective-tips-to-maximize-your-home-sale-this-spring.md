<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three ways you can get your home show-ready for the upcoming spring market at little cost.</em></p>

The spring selling season is upon us, and if you’re looking to get in on the action during this high-activity time, here are three simple, yet effective, ways you can prepare your home for the market.&nbsp;

**1. Clean up your yard and exterior.** It’s probably the No. 1 most important thing you can do for your home’s outward presentation. The cheapest way to make your home sparkle from the outside is to powerwash it, along with your driveway, and mow the lawn to ensure a freshly cut, clean look. After all, 80% of buyers make their decision within the first 10 to 15 seconds based on the appearance of the front yard and exterior of the home.&nbsp;

**2. Declutter.** We, as homeowners, often fall into the habit of amassing too many items in our home, and tidying up will give your property a cozier feel as buyers walk through. Some ways to achieve this include holding a yard sale or donating some of your needless clutter to GoodWill. And it’s worth mentioning that we have professional stagers who can assist you in decorating your property once it’s clear of all that extra stuff.

**3. Touch up some of the paint in and around your home.** Contrary to what you might hear from some, you don’t need to repaint your entire house. Instead, focus on commonly touched spots in the home—your doors and the trim along your walkways, for example. Sure, you may have a wall here or there that could use a fresh coat of paint, but this doesn’t require repainting every inch of every wall. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>We expect to be in a definite seller’s market this year, so I caution you not to put a lot of money into preparing your home for sale; you’ll run the risk of overspending, without much promise for a return.&nbsp;

Before you spend more than a few hundred dollars getting your home ready for the spring market, we encourage you to reach out and give us a call. We’ll fill you in on the dos and don’ts and walk you through the process so you don’t leave money on the table. &nbsp;

As always, we’re never too busy for a referral of a friend or family member of yours, and we look forward to seeing you at the closing table!
