Are you or someone you know a veteran or active-duty member of the United States military? If so, Coldwell Banker is here to serve you.

**Coldwell Banker is a preferred service provider of USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union**, and I am personally a preferred agent of these two credit unions.

As a preferred provider, Coldwell Banker can help former or active-duty military personnel receive a discount in the form or a rebate check on closing costs for a home purchase.

**The amount of this discount depends on a few factors, but it typically ranges from $1,000 to $3,000, and sometimes more**.

So if you qualify, please give me a call. As a preferred service provider, our team would be more than happy to help you with your real estate needs. We truly want to give back to those who have served the country.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
