Today I’m sharing some information on an opening here at The Dan Jones Team.

When you look back on 2019, were you able to achieve the goals you set for yourself?&nbsp;

If you’ve been seriously wondering how to elevate your real estate career, look us up. We’re one of the top teams here in the Carolinas, and **we’re always looking for A+ talent.** Though we don’t have many available spots on our team, we always make room for stellar individuals.

Currently, **we do have one open position**. If you’d like to schedule a confidential conversation, feel free to reach out via phone or email. Let me know what your 2019 goals were, where you triumphed, and where you fell short. Additionally, I’d love to hear what bar you’ve set for yourself in 2020.&nbsp;

Together we can come up with a roadmap for how to reach your goals this year. I’ll share the details of how agents on our team sell 30 to 40-plus houses in their first year with us. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
