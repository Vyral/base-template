Guaranteed offer companies are becoming more and more popular these days.&nbsp;

You’ve probably heard them advertised on television. But there’s actually a dark truth behind their claims of a hassle-free deal, and today I’m going to blow the whistle on what these companies don’t tell you.&nbsp;

**These companies make it seem like the normal selling process is majorly inconvenient, but this isn’t true.** In fact, if you work with an experienced agent you’ll almost certainly earn a higher level of success through a traditional selling experience than by working with one of these guaranteed offer companies.&nbsp;

To illustrate this, I recently ran an analysis on the results you might achieve from selling to one of the most popular guaranteed offer companies (Opendoor.com) versus what you could expect from a normal listing experience.&nbsp;

For this analysis, I took six months’ worth of local sales from our market and ran the numbers to find out exactly how these two selling options stack up against one another. Of course, I also accounted for Opendoor’s fee—an expense they fail to mention in their advertisements.

The bottom line is this: In comparing the actual sold price of the 92 homes that closed in the six-month period I examined during this analysis to the price those same homes would have been sold for to Opendoor, **sellers opting into the guaranteed offer route would have been left with $9,384 less in their pocket by the end of the deal.&nbsp;**

So, is the supposed convenience of working with these guaranteed offer companies really worth leaving nearly $10,000 on the table? I don’t think so.&nbsp;

**If you truly want a convenient, profitable deal, your best option is to partner with an experienced, knowledgeable Realtor to sell your home on the open market.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
