Since Halloween has recently passed, let's discuss a question buyers occasionally ask: "Has someone died in the home I want to purchase?"

There are some superstitious people out there who worry about that kind of event in a home. There are other adventurous people who seek out these properties.

Disclosure law in Oregon does not require the seller to disclose a death in the home. Many states in our country have similar laws.

However, if you want to find out, you can visit a website called DiedInHouse.com. This site searches public and private records to provide you a report on any deaths, fires, or drug activity on a property. Homes that are stigmatized can be less popular and sit on the market for a while. Some homes are even torn down, depending on what happened.

If you have any questions about today's video, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
