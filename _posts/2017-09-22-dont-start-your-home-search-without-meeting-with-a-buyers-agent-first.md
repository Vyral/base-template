If you’re a first-time homebuyer, **it’s imperative that you to meet with a seasoned buyer’s agent and do a buyer’s consultation before doing anything else.**

I know I sound like a broken record because I’ve discussed this topic so many times in the past, but I still feel like buyer’s don’t quite understand the importance of doing this.

In the state of Connecticut, we real estate agents either represent the interests of the seller or the buyer, and we have something called “**buyer brokerage,**” where a real estate agency and/or a Realtor can represent you exclusively as a buyer.

I see way too many buyers in the marketplace trying to go it alone. They try to find the perfect house, negotiate on their own behalf with seasoned real estate agents, get everything they want in the contract, and sometimes even try to get their contract accepted in a multiple offer situation without any representation.

We’ve been through this process many times—I’ve worked with hundreds of first-time homebuyers. It’s absolutely to your benefit to sit down with a team like us and talk about the home buying process. **We can walk you through the whole process from A to Z,** and we also offer a first-time homebuyer’s guide that can show you every step of buying a home.

If you have any questions or you’d like to have a buyer consultation with us, don’t hesitate to call or email us anytime. We’d love to help you.
