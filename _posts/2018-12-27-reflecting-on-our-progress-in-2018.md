The Luxury Listing Specialists did 13 live certification classes this past year, from the east coast to down south, and even north to Canada. Overall, we had agents from 27 states represented. **With all our training and activities this past year, we definitely racked up some frequent flyer miles.**

Beyond that, there were a few other points from 2018 that I’m excited to share with you:

* We formed a strategic alliance with “Who’s Who in Luxury Real Estate?”, and we were fortunate enough to present at both of their conferences.
* In just the second half of the year, we had 155 RE/MAX Integra agents get certified. There are over 40,000 agents in total at RE/MAX Integra; they own most of the RE/MAX franchises the world over. Now, they’ve already booked us for two more live certification classes in 2019.
* We gave away over $50,000 in Lux scholarships, for which agents who are coming on tough times can apply.
* We were also recognized by the International Property Award as not only one of the best consulting businesses for agents looking to sell high-end properties in the nation but also globally.

**For the Luxury Listing Specialists, it was truly a great year, and we hope that yours was just as momentous.**
