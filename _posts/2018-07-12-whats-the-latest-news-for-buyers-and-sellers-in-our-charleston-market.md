What’s been happening in the Charleston market in 2017?

<strong>We’ve had a great year for sales.</strong> The median sale price is $316,119. Keep in mind, that’s just for Charleston County. If we added in other counties, it might bring that number down. Our average days on market—or how long it takes for the average home to sell—has held steady since last year and is currently 58 days, which is unbelievable considering that number was closer to 90 and even 120 days a few years back.

What does our steady market mean for buyers? It means there is currently less inventory available for winter sales. <strong>Though there aren’t as many homes to choose from, the homes that are available have very incentivized sellers.</strong> You should be able to find a few homes you like and try to negotiate with the seller to reduce their price.

For sellers, does this mean you shouldn’t put your home on the market? No! What it does mean, though, is <strong>you absolutely cannot defer any maintenance on your house.</strong> To get your home ready for sale, get it painted, declutter the interior, get it looking in excellent condition, and add one “wow!” factor to it. This can mean something as big as upgrading your kitchen or as simple as updating your countertops. On the exterior, the three P’s apply—you need to pressure wash, put out some pine straw, and add a nice, colorful potted plant.

There aren’t a ton of things you must do, but you must get your entire home in excellent condition if you want to get it sold during the fall and winter.

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
