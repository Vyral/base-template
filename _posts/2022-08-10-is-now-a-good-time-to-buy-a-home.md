For those of you who are asking if now is still a good time to purchase a home, this is for you\! Prices and interest rates are not projected to go down, especially not any time soon. This has knocked 20-30% buyers out of housing market. However, don't let it knock you out of the market without looking at the facts and numbers\!

Buying a home right now makes sense for a long term (at least 5 years of owning) situation. If you were to rent for 5 years at $2,500 per month, you're throwing away $144,000 in rent\! On the flip side, if you were to buy at $450,000, with 10% down, you'll have around $112,000 of tax deductions at the end of 5 years. It's much smarter to pay 6% interest in mortgage rather than 100% interest in rent\!&nbsp;
