Today, Loudoun County is in a buyer’s market. It’s a terrific time to purchase a home! Here's why:

1. We're experiencing historically low interest rates. Recently, one of our clients received 3.5% on a fixed rate 30-year loan. It doesn't get any better than that. Rates can't get any lower!
2. The Fed announced that interest rates will remain steady throughout the rest of the year. The Fed didn't mention next year, so now is the time to jump on a great opportunity. Every slight increase of interest rates directly affects you as a buyer.
3. The current inventory is amazing! There are so many choices out there.

With historically low interest rates and a diverse inventory, now is an excellent opportunity to buy. Give me a shout with any real estate questions! I'm always here to help.
