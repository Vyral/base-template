<center><em>Here&rsquo;s why an influx of new construction buyers is great news for homeowners.</em></center>

<br>Here we go again with the new construction lines around the block. Just this past weekend, we were bombarded with new construction buyers, but there’s a problem: **There’s just not enough inventory to keep up with demand**.

We talked to one builder who released a bunch of homes recently and sold them within minutes. There's such a demand for homes in our area that builders can’t build fast enough and buyers are trying to buy earlier and earlier in the process.

**From a seller’s perspective, this is a perfect opportunity**. If you wanted to make a change, downsize, or just sell and move somewhere else, now’s the time to do so. The market needs an inventory, and buyers are willing to pay a premium for the right home.

On the flip side, interest rates are low if you are thinking about buying. If you can sell now and wait a bit to see if more inventory comes on the market, that might lead to a perfect combination of selling high and buying low. You can also capitalize on the market now with those historically low interest rates.

If you have any questions about what’s going on in the market or your own situation, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
