<center><em>Bad communication ruins relationships and real estate transactions. Here&rsquo;s our communication guarantee to you at Atlas Premier Realty.</em></center>

<br>We’re excited to talk to you about something new that we’re doing here at Atlas Premier Realty that is a little different. One of the things that we’re finding is that people often have issues with lack of communication when it comes to real estate.

**What we’ve come up with in response is our Blue Tape Communication Guarantee**. When you are working with one of our agents, we guarantee that you will speak to your agent or another person on our team at least every week.

Communication can be a pain point for any relationship, but especially in real estate. It’s one of the more stressful and emotionally charged events people will go through, so communication is vitally important.

This guarantee is meant to help us stay on the ball. **If we don’t communicate with you at least once a week when working with us, we’re happy to give a portion of the commission back to you at closing if we drop the ball at all**. We’re putting our money where our mouth is.

If you want to learn more about this program or if you have any real estate related questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
