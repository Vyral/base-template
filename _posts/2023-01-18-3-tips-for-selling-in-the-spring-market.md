If you're looking to sell your home in the spring, I want you to know that, from start to finish, it'll take about 90 to 100 days to sell your home. Here are a few things I want you to keep in mind as you prepare for that home sale:

1. **Start with your goals.** When do you want to be moved into that new home? Work backward to know the time when you have to start getting your home prepared.&nbsp;
2. **Prepare the interior.** What type of staging do you need to do? Are there any upgrades that need to be done? Does painting need to be done to give the home a new, vibrant look?
3. **Curb appeal.** What type of exterior maintenance can you improve? If you're looking to sell in the spring, you’ll want to do your exterior photos when your grass is green and flowerbeds look fresh. Curb appeal is so important because it is buyers’ first impression.

If you have any questions, give us a call, text, or email. We'd love to help.
