Do you need a website as a real estate agent in this marketplace? Lots of agents I talk to seem to think they don't need them anymore. Here's why I think they're crucial.

As a real estate agent in this market, should you have a website? A lot of agents ask me if anyone even needs a website in this market anymore.

 My answer is this: **your website is your calling card.** It's where people go to find out whether you're legitimate or not. They want to see whether you list and sell homes.

 I encourage anyone who is serious about the real estate business to either join a team with a great website or a company with a great website. It's hard to buy a $50 solution to a website and still be seen as legitimate in the marketplace.

**In short, when companies like mine spend tens of thousands of dollars every month on websites, it's hard to compete if you have a cheap, $50 website.** Every website manufacturer out there will tell you it's possible, but it's simply not.

 If you're going to be a real estate agent and take the job seriously, I suggest you spend the money on the tools to do the job right. If you have any questions about how we do it and who we use or if you're interested in joining our team, give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!
