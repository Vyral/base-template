If you’re in the market to sell a home, you’ve probably been wondering how you can net the most amount of money on your sale. I’ve got some tips to share today to help you get there. It’s not just a matter of putting a sign up; it’s about the overall strategy. Here are three of the strategies we use on a regular basis:

**1. A “Coming Soon” program.** We use this strategy to our advantage when pricing a home and getting it ready for the market.

**2. Price for multiple offers.** When we price a home a little bit lower than its market value, it often encourages multiple offers, which nets the sellers better terms and more money.

**3. Have a plan “b.”** Things happen, so we need to have a contingency plan in place just in case. This ensures that we can still go forward with our plans if something happens to go wrong with the transaction.

**4. Be creative with pricing and marketing.** There are plenty of ways where we can make a transaction a win-win for both parties just by knowing how to price and negotiate.

If you have any questions about any of these strategies or want to learn more about how we get homes in Clarksville sold for top dollar, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
