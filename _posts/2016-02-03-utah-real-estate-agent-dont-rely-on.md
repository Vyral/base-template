Today we are talking about our third tip to sell your home faster and for more money. **Today we are talking about one of the most important aspects of your home sale, home pricing.**

When you’re getting ready to sell and figuring out where to price, one thing you want to avoid is relying on third-party data, like a Zillow Zestimate or other automated home valuation sites. **This information can give you a misunderstanding about what your home value is.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

We recently heard of a new agent in the business who was using tax data to determine the value of a home they were selling. **The value they came up with was drastically below market value, and was a steal for the buyer that gobbled it up.** Zillow’s Zestimate is pretty inaccurate, as they don’t take into account any upgrades or improvements made on your house.

**What you really need to price your home correctly is a great agent who knows what they are doing when it comes to pricing.** Someone who can use current market data and facts to help determine your home’s true value.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!
