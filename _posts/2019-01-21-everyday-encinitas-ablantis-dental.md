&nbsp;

For the first episode of “Everyday Encinitas,” I’m visiting Ablantis Dental and speaking with Dr. Claudia Cordati.

Claudia has been practicing dentistry since 2005, and she opened up her office here in Encinitas in 2013. **She now has a five-person team behind her and she loves the community and the fact that she ends up being friends with so many of her patients**.

There are many tools a dentist uses, and Claudia’s dentistry changed many years ago when she changed the technology she uses. If one of her patients needs a crown, for instance, they only need to make one visit now.

Claudia cites her listening skills as one of the primary reasons patients choose her. Family is important to Claudia, just like it is with me, and **one of my favorite things about her practice is how she continues to grow and nurture the relationships she has with her clients**. She likes to work with people, and she explains that she does a better job if she knows the patient she’s treating.

What’s the one dental hygiene tip Claudia would like to share to the world?

“Brush your teeth,” she says. “It’s better than anything else that I can do.”

Near the end of the video, you can see testimonials from both patients and employees of Ablantis Dental. If you’d like to know more about Ablantis Dental or you want to schedule an appointment with them, **call (760) 334-0128 or&nbsp;[visit their website](https://ablantisdental.com/){: target="_blank"}**.
