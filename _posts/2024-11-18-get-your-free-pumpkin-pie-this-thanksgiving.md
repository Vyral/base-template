Last year, we gave out 1,200 pies. Community groups told us how much it meant to their events, and families raved about how tasty the pies were. These pies are huge. Think of a pumpkin pizza but way better. Every year, people tell us how delicious they are. You’ll be proud to serve one at your table. Our sponsors make this event possible. Thanks to their support, we’re able to keep this tradition going strong.

Don’t miss this chance to make your Thanksgiving even better. **Text PIE to 35620 right now and** [**click here**](https://www.mistysoldteamiowa.com/pumpkinpie){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} **to reserve your pumpkin pie.** Pick it up on Monday or Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and get ready to enjoy a sweet, memorable holiday.
