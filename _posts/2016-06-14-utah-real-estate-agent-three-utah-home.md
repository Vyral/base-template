The point of staging your home is to make it look open, clean, and inviting to potential buyers. You want to make your home stand apart from others on the market, and you can do this in three different ways.

1. **The 50% Rule:** This means that you should eliminate 50% of everything in your home. When you’re preparing to move out of your home, it’s a good opportunity to get rid of what you don’t need. Either donate it, put it in storage, or toss it. This goes for furniture, decor, and everything else.

2. **The Basketball Rule:** Eliminate anything smaller than the size of a basketball. Small objects can make a room feel cramped and compact, so get rid of picture frames, books, knickknacks, and other things that are smaller than the size of a basketball.

3. **Bare Countertops Rule:** Clearing off your countertops is an essential part of making your home feel larger and more open. Whatever you have laying around on your countertops, get rid of it. You’ll thank us later.
