Here’s what to know about this year’s pie giveaway.&nbsp;

Mark your calendars for Tuesday, November 24, for our fourth annual Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway\! Given the unique circumstances of this year, we’ll be tweaking our tradition a little; instead of having you drop by our offices to **pick up a delicious pumpkin, apple, or pecan pie,** we’ll be handing out pies from underneath a tent as folks drive by. Of course, we’ll be wearing gloves and masks, and we welcome you to do the same. In just a couple of weeks, we’ll be sending out an email to alert you via video update as to how you can register for the event and indicate what type of pie you want.

As always, our Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway is open to all of our wonderful past clients. I can’t stress enough how large and scrumptious these pies are\! **Our drive-by pie tent will be set up in front of our RE/MAX Properties East Building** (10525 Timberwood Circle), and our goal is to have all the pies right there and ready to go. You’ll pull up, we’ll ask for your name, we’ll safely take a picture of you in your car (if you want), and then we’ll hand you a pie that you can enjoy during a beautiful Thanksgiving Day dinner.&nbsp;

Again, stay tuned for more details, and we hope to see you there\! As always, reach out if you have any upcoming real estate needs or pressing questions. We at the Sokoler Team are here to help\!
