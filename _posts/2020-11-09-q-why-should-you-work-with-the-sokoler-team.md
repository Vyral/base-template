*Why work with the Sokoler Team? Let our past clients tell you.*

I'm here today with Kenny, a client whose home we just helped sell. We listed his home at $50,000 and he ended up getting $50,000. I bring that up because people tend to think that we only list highly priced homes, but in reality, we list all types of homes here at the Sokoler Group.

So we helped Kenny sell his home, but the real question is how did we perform during the process? Well, Kenny was very pleased—we sold his home in just one day\!

Even during COVID, we have been slammed with business, and we’ve strived to make every client’s experience as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. **Beginning at the 1:30 mark in the video above, you can hear what previous clients have to say about working with us to sell their homes.**
