Why should you hire Govig? We stand out from the competition in a few important ways.

First of all, as the vice president and executive recruiter, I’ve been in the industry for more than 18 years, so I appreciate the challenges operators face. In those 18 years, I’ve made some great contacts with passively looking people you wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

Secondly, **we have an awesome team.**Our average tenure is seven-and-a-half years, and last year we had 239 hires. We work on positions from the facility level all the way to the C suite. With that tenure, we really know the blocking and tackling of recruitment.

Lastly, **we share our customized recruitment strategy.** In other words, we have a playbook we can make work for you specifically. This gives us a tremendous advantage.

If you have any questions or want to know more about us, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to speak with you.
