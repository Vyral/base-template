How can technology attract high-end buyers to your home? HGTV actually said that 46% of consumers think technology is very important for their current or future residencies. In fact, Digital Interior said that 94% of buyers surveyed would sacrifice 1,000 square feet of living space for new technology in their new home.

Obviously, technology is important to home buyers. One of the latest trends in home technology that will draw high-end buyers is the smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to control the temperature in your home from your smartphone. You can change the temperature from your couch or your car while going to work.

Home surveillance technology is also very important. Cameras can be mounted discreetly on the walls and ceilings. Buyers will appreciate that they can check in on their home even if they are at work or on vacation. Not only that, you will feel more secure knowing that you can see what is going on in your home.

 You should also pay attention to technological developments in the kitchen. There are touchless water faucets that come on with just a hand motion, and there are also smart refrigerators. Smart refrigerators will alert you when you’re running low on groceries so that you know when it’s time to head to the store. You can also get a Bluetooth thermostat so that your meals will be perfectly cooked all the time.

Finally, luxury entertainment is always a big draw for home buyers. Flat screen TVs and home theaters are fantastic. Not only that, you can control your entertainment system, your security system, and your thermostat from one remote control by Savant!
