<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Boosting curb appeal, repainting, and targeting the kitchen and bathrooms are the best things sellers can do to raise their home's value. Here’s why.</em></p>

Here are three things you can focus on to sell your home quicker and for more money:&nbsp;

**1\. Curb appeal.** This can get you more money than just about anything else, because when buyers drive by the house, they’ll either be turned off, unimpressed, or enticed.&nbsp;

Exterior paint is relatively inexpensive, and adding a fresh coat of it is a great way to spruce things up. While you’re at it, add some fresh mulch to the lawn and garden and clear away dead, soggy leaves. Coming off the heels of winter, we may not have a lot of decent days to work with, but these outdoor projects are worth planning.&nbsp;

**2\. Fresh interior paint.** Nothing impresses a buyer more than seeing a home’s interior coated in fresh paint. Again, it’s inexpensive, and eliminates the possibility of buyers getting hung up on marks or scratches.&nbsp;

**3\. Bathroom or kitchen renovations.** Of course, these can be more expensive and extensive than an afternoon of painting, but these renovations are the ones that matter most to buyers.&nbsp;

You could start yourself by painting the cabinets, or you could hire a good local contractor. We have a list of trusted contractors we’d be happy to share with you if you reach out to us. Updating knobs on drawers and appliances and installing more modern light fixtures in both rooms can also go a long way.&nbsp;

Countertops are relatively inexpensive—you don’t always have to go with quartz or granite; laminate countertops can really freshen up a home and bring it out of the 1970s and ‘80s.&nbsp;

In our experience helping many sellers prepare for and complete a home sale, those three focus areas offer the best chances at raising your home’s value. &nbsp;

Inventory is low as we head into spring 2020, and we want to make sure you get top dollar for your home.
