<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Before you hire any agent or team to assist in the sale of your home, there are certain questions you must ask them.</em></p>

Before you hire an agent or team of agents to assist you with your home selling experience, you’ll need to make sure they’re the right fit for the job. The best way to determine this is by simply asking the right questions.&nbsp;

To help you do this, **our team recently put together a guide on the top 10 questions you must ask before hiring a listing agent to sell your home.** We would be happy to send you a free copy of this guide by mail or email, but, for now, we’d like to give you a preview of just a couple of these questions.&nbsp;

The first (and potentially most important) question you should ask any agent before you hire them is: **“Can I fire you if I’m not satisfied?”**&nbsp;

No one wants to be stuck working with a professional who they aren’t happy with. Any listing agent you work with should be willing to let you walk away if they aren’t delivering the results you want and deserve.&nbsp;

The second question in this guide is: **“Do you have actual results?”&nbsp;**

Anyone can talk the talk, but only truly qualified agents will be able to back their claims up with a proven track record of success. Our team, for example, has a full list of statistics pertaining to our past and current success in the industry. 96% of our team’s listings are successful. The average success rate of other agents in our market, meanwhile, is just 61.6%. Our team also maintains a 98% list-to-sales price ratio. This is 4% higher than the 94% list-to-sales price ratio held by the average agent in our market.&nbsp;

Part of the reason for our success is our team structure, which brings me to another important question: **Is the agent you’re thinking about working with part of a team or are they working alone?&nbsp;**

Whereas a team structure allows each of its agents to focus their energy into specialized tasks, solo agents are left to handle everything on their own. As the old saying goes, “A Jack of all trades is a master of none.”&nbsp;

The questions and tips we’ve shared today are just a small preview of the wealth of information that’s available in our full guide.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want a copy of this guide for yourself, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
