For our latest community spotlight, we decided to speak to business partners Angel Flather and Kelly Gelletly of Designs by Angilique. Our team has recently partnered with this business in order to improve the staging services we’re able to offer our clients.&nbsp;

**Not only do Angel and Kelly offer staging and interior design, but they also create market preparation reports for our seller agents.** These reports are very helpful for our agents, as they allow them to more effectively create and present online listings for clients.

And through a method called “soft staging,” wherein minimal changes are made to the decor to make a home look more neutral and up to date, Angel and Kelly can use a seller’s own furniture instead of hauling in all new pieces. Vacant homes, meanwhile, will be fully staged with furniture Angel and Kelly bring in. **It all depends on the individual property.**&nbsp;

So if you’re an agent looking to add to your resources, a seller looking for help with staging your home, or a homeowner interested in improving your property’s interior design, I highly encourage you to check out Designs by Angilique.
