There are a few vices that you want to avoid if you want to sell your home.

First, make sure you don’t **overimprove your home.** If you want to do a large master bathroom remodel or kitchen remodel, then I would recommend finding out what’s going on in your neighbor’s houses. What does your neighbor’s bathroom look like? What does their kitchen look like? Similar houses in your neighborhood will really determine the value of your property.

If you do proceed with a remodel, **don’t remodel without permits.** If you don’t get the proper permits, then you allow the buyer to doubt that the work was done by licensed professionals. If they are worried about the quality of the remodel, then chances are you will get a lower bid or price.

**Don’t limit your showing hours.** Buyers have busy schedules just like you do, so it’s important that you are flexible with your showing hours in order to get the maximum exposure on your home.

Finally, make sure that you follow your agent's advice. A lot of folks don’t want to follow their agent’s advice, but your Realtor is a professional. You are paying them to sell your home. You have to trust and have confidence in their knowledge of the area.

By avoiding these problems, you will have a successful home sale. If you have any other questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
