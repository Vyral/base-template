It’s time for an update on our current real estate market.

Right now is an interesting time for both buyers and sellers alike. Despite an influx of inventory, prices continue to increase. That said, buyers are really starting to take a step back, only jumping in when they believe they are receiving value from their purchase.

**The best advice that I can give to sellers is to look at their home from a buyers perspective**, look at the information that is available and price their home competitively. A buyer is considering the condition of the home and the value. Sellers need to take into consideration where the market is going, and price ahead of other sellers. If a home is overpriced in this market, a buyer will probably not make an offer and the home will sit.

**At the Stacy Esser Group, we just had multiple examples of homes sitting on the market until the slightest price drop.** Buyers are sensitive in this market, and even the smallest price drop will put your home within the threshold of value. If you’re looking to sell, you have to be careful about leaving room for negotiation. You cannot negotiate a bid until you get one, so you have to understand the actions of buyers in this market, and price appropriately.
