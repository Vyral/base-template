Before you make your first home purchase, there are 10 important terms you need to know.

**1. Fixed-rate mortgage.** This is a mortgage that has a fixed-rate during its term. So if you have a rate of 4.25% on a five-, 10-, 15-, or 25-year mortgage, your rate will not change during this time unless you refinance.

**2. Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).** This is the opposite of a fixed-rate mortgage. With an ARM, you will have a shorter term of between five or 10 years. The details of this style of mortgage can be complicated, so I recommend you speak more in-depth on the subject with your lender.

**3. Pre-qualification.**This is the process where a lender verifies your ability to obtain financing for a home. To become pre-qualified, you will provide the lender with a number of documents.

**4. Conventional loan.**This type of loan typically carries a 30-year mortgage. To qualify for a conventional loan, you need a minimum credit score of 650. Also, the average down payment for a conventional loan is 5%.

**5. FHA loan**. This loan product is great for anyone who has had credit problems. It allows you to put just 3.5% down, but you will have to carry mortgage insurance on the loan. However, you can take this insurance off at a later time.

**6. Appraisal.** This is the process wherein a 3rd-party company examines your home’s value compared to other similar properties in the vicinity. Factors such as a home’s condition, style, lot-size, and more are all taken into consideration.

**7. Mortgage insurance.** This is insurance designed to protect the bank. To avoid paying it, you will need to put at least 20% down. There are ways around this, though, and plenty of programs allow you to forgo this cost.

**8. Closing costs.**These expenses, which will include things like the cost of your home inspection, will likely amount to between 2% and 5% of the purchase price.

**9. Buying down your interest rate.** If you have a high interest rate due to your credit score, you can pay cash to literally buy down your rate.

**10. Escrow.** An escrow account is a locked account that holds the buyer’s deposit so that neither they or the seller can withdraw it.
