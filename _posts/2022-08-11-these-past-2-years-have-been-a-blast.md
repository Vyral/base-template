I’ve been on the Central Iowa Real Estate Scoreboard for over two years\! It’s been an incredible opportunity, so today I’ll go over some of my favorite moments.

I look forward to this show every week. Talking to guests and covering various headlines gives me a great reason to dive into topics more than I would have otherwise. Even just putting together the information is fun.

People tell me all the time that they love the show, and I’ve even had strangers recognize my voice\! It’s such a neat way to connect with people. **I also love covering topics that people maybe don’t understand as much.** We get to point out the unsung heroes like inspectors and title guys and explain what they do.&nbsp;

It’s been a great two years on this show, and I hope we have many more ahead. If you have any questions about real estate, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.
