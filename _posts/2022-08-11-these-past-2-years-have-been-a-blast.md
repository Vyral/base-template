I've been on The Central Iowa Real Estate Scoreboard with co-host Heather Burnside, airing Sundays at 9:30am on KxNO 106.3FM for over two years\! It has been an incredible opportunity, so today I’ll go over some of my favorite parts.

I look forward to this show every week. Talking to guests and covering various headlines gives me a great reason to dive into topics more than I would have otherwise. Even just putting together the information is fun.

People tell me all the time that they love the show, and I’ve even had strangers recognize my voice\! It’s such a neat way to connect with people. **I also love covering topics that people maybe don’t understand as much.** We get to point out the unsung heroes like inspectors and title guys and explain what they do.&nbsp;

One of the biggest surprises was that my co-host, local radio legend Heather Burnside, loved our topics so much, she is now a licensed real estate agent on my team\!

It’s been a great two years on this show, and I hope we have many more ahead. If you have any questions about real estate, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.
