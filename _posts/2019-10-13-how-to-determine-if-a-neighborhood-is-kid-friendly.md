One of our subscribers, Kelly, recently asked us a great question: **“How do I know if a neighborhood is kid-friendly?”&nbsp;**

This is something we hear all the time from homebuyers, particularly those moving to a town or area they’re unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, it is a Fair Housing violation for Realtors to answer this question directly. Therefore, we would like to offer you some advice on how to identify such neighborhoods on your own, instead.&nbsp;

First, **spend some time in the neighborhood you’re thinking of buying in before making a move.** Visiting the neighborhood at different times of the day and different points throughout the week will help you gauge what kind of lifestyle its residents lead.&nbsp;

If you see a lot of children out and about, if you notice local amenities that cater to families, or if you know the area to be within a high-quality school district, these are all good signs that you’ve found a child-friendly place to live. **Looking for swingsets or other play equipment in back yards throughout the neighborhood as you drive through is also a good idea.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is that there are many ways to test the “feel” of a neighborhood before you and your family move there.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
