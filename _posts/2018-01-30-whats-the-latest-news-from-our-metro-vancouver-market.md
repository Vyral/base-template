I hope you’ve had a great start to the new year so far. How has our Metro Vancouver market done this January compared to December 2017, though?

**House sales remained the same as last December**, with an active ratio of 15%. Home prices are still negotiable, and some are even selling below their tax assessment. This may mean a great opportunity to buy a house this spring.

For condos, the active-to-sales ratio dropped from 58% to 27%. This drop in activity may be related to new mortgage stress-testing rules and higher interest rates. As a general rule, we tend to see decreases in home prices when we get consecutive months of active-to-sales ratios below 12%. If you own a condo, this means you’re still safe and prices are still trending upward.

If you’ve been stressing out about the new mortgage stress testing that took effect January 21, I have an update for you. **Some credit unions are still not adhering to the stress test.** I also found out from a mortgage broker that if you purchased a home before November 2016, you can refinance without stress-testing.

Also, if you’re thinking about increasing your down payment up to 20% to avoid the insurance premium, you may be able to get a lower mortgage rate—up to 0.5%—with a higher ratio insured mortgage. You may end up saving more money throughout your mortgage term with the lower interest rate versus a larger down-payment. &nbsp;So make sure you work out your calculations properly.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
