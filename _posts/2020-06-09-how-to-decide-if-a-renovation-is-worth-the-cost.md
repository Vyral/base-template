If you’ve ever watched HGTV, you know that they are big on home renovations.&nbsp; Chef-quality kitchens. Huge master bedrooms and bathrooms.&nbsp; Updating of outdoor spaces.

And, it costs a lot of money.

So, how do you decide if a renovation is worth the cost—and will it add or decrease the value of your home?

To make an informed decision, consider the following:

* Consider how long you will live in your home. If you plan on staying in your home for 15 to 20 years, enjoy your renovation.&nbsp; If you are updating it to sell it within the next few years, determine whether your choices will appeal to a potential buyer.
* Consult an Expert. Talk to a professional contractor or designer.&nbsp; They will tell you whether it’s a passing trend or if it’s a classic update that will withstand the test of time.
* Compare your home renovations to other homes in your area. Ask a real estate agent to show you comparable homes for sale.&nbsp; Attend open houses to make sure your improvement aligns with the neighborhood.
* Get an appraisal. A licensed appraiser can do a “feasibility study”.&nbsp; They can estimate the current value of your home and the value after the proposed improvements.
