Today I want to talk about something kind of unique. Obviously we are in the business of helping buyers find homes and homeowners find buyers. However, what we don't often talk about is how expert agents connect the two. It's not Facebook or Zillow that connects buyers and sellers. Instead, it often comes down to making those hard calls.

It drives buyers up the wall to make an offer on a home only to find out that it is already off the market.

**If you’re a buyer, we want you to know that we understand that we are on the same team.** Agents do a lot of work behind the scenes, like calling homeowners to see if they want to sell. They may also try to find off-market properties for you to look at.

At Expert Home Advisors, we take it a step further. If we sell a home in a neighborhood, we will call around that area and let the neighbors know that the home just sold.

Typically, we tell them how successful the sale was and also ask they’re interested in selling. If they say yes, then we enter them into a database that we keep track of on a daily basis. This way, our buyers **have the chance to see properties nobody else knows about.**

This has helped us build a great referral base and gain awesome reviews from trustworthy clientele.

We have connected so many owners and buyers just by calling around and adding people to our database. Imagine what would happen if all real estate agents put that kind of labor into it.

If you have any questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact us. We would love the opportunity to show you how the homebuying process works and how we are out working for you.
