I see homebuyers make the same mistakes over and over because they aren’t 100% sure what they are doing. To help out future homebuyers, I want to share **three things a homebuyer should never do in any situation.**

**1. Never quit.** Real estate values are continuing to rise and they rarely go down. If you give up, you’ll end up with nothing and join the ranks of those who spend the rest of their lives talking about the deal that got away. I have heard so many stories about properties that people almost bought or always wanted to buy. When I ask what happened, many of them simply reply with, “I gave up.” It’s a common answer, &nbsp;but don’t let it be your answer. If you’re losing out on offers, find out exactly why and secure the next property.

**2. Never rely on verbals.** Verbal assurances from sellers, home inspectors, and even real estate professionals don’t mean much. In real estate, it’s what is on paper that counts.

**3. Never think the work is over once the offer is accepted.** Having your offer accepted is terrific; however, the house belongs to the seller until the closing day and a lot can happen during that time. We only celebrate once we give you your new keys at the end of closing.

If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
