  Our goal this year is to make an impact on the community through charitable
  donations. What better way to give back than to lend our support to an
  organization that benefits cancer patients the world over? Lisa’s Army is one
  such organization that donates care packages to those going to cancer
  treatment. You’re invited to help us raise at least $10,000 to give to their
  cause and have a great time while you’re at it. To learn more about Lisa’s
  Army and the details of our fundraiser, watch my latest video.

Today I’m here with my great friend, Abbi Cobb. Abbi and I have very similar goals for this year, and one of them was to raise $10,000 for an amazing charity.

Because contribution and giving back to our community are important to us, we wanted to tell you about an awesome event that we’re hosting on March 3 at 7:00 p.m. at 510 Johnny’s in Bel Air.

Lisa’s Army is a charitable organization that sends free customized care packagesall around the world to patients undergoing cancer treatment. **We want to donate to their cause.**

Since there are so many cancer organizations out there, why Lisa’s Army?<br><br>Abbi learned that her sister had colon cancer a month before she visited the Lisa’s Army booth at a women’s conference in Pennsylvania, so it hit really close to home. She had an opportunity to talk to Lisa’s Army to find out more about the care packages that they make. She knew that she wanted to nominate her sister for a care package.<br><br>But she also wanted to do more. Abbi contacted their fundraising department to see how she could help. And since we both had made goals to raise money for charity, what better way is there than to help an organization that touches everyone? So many of our friends and family are affected by cancer, **so this is an opportunity to give back.**

We’re working on some really cool things for this event. There will be 50-50s, &nbsp;raffles with great prizes, a photobooth, a deejay, and much more. &nbsp;We will serve appetizers, dinner, and dessert. It will take place on a Saturday night, so sleep all day, get a babysitter, and come to the party!

You’ll receive an invitation in the mail. **Fill out the RSVP card** and let us who if you’re coming and whether or not you’ll be bringing guests.<br><br>You can also forward this to friends and family to encourage them to donate, get involved, or help sponsor the event. It’s going to be a lot of fun, and **we appreciate any support you’re able to give,** whether it’s a pair of socks or a check for $10,000.

Our main goal is to have an impact on the community through charitable donations, and this is how we plan to kick off 2018. We look forward to seeing you there.
