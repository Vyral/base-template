Today I’m excited to be coming to you from one of Buda’s newest stores: Thatcher. To learn a little more about the business and how it began, I spoke with owners Laura Howard and Mel Woods. Laura and Mel both live here In Buda with their families.

According to Mel, she and Laura have always had a dream of working together and supporting their community. **They have a passion for making life simple as well as for natural cleaning products.** It was this passion that they wanted to bring to Buda.

Outside of simply running the store, Mel and Laura also get involved in the community in other ways.{% include pullquote.html %}**On October 25th, they are running a fall flower workshop for pumpkin floral arrangements at the Buda Public Library.&nbsp;**Also, they are hosting a workshop at BudaFest on December 3rd for making floral arrangements with mistletoe.

In the future, they also hope to host future workshops at the store itself.

To keep track of everything going on with Thatcher, you can find the store on Instagram @ThatcherBuda and on Facebook as well. The store also has an email list you can find on either of these social media outlets.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
