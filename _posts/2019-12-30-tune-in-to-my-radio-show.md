<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s all the information you need to know about my radio show and how to win a Starbucks gift card from me!</em></p>

Today we’re going to discuss a radio program that I’ve been doing for quite some time. If you’re interested in tuning in, **it airs every Monday around 2 p.m. on 650 AM KENI** (sometimes it airs a few minutes before or after 2 p.m.). It follows the Sean Hannity Show.&nbsp;

I’m also looking for some ideas or questions that you might be interested in hearing about on the show. I would love for you to email me those at [askdar@alaskatopagent.com](mailto:askdar@alaskatopagent.com). If you send us a question or idea, I will send you a Starbucks gift card\!

In the meantime, if you’d like to go back and listen to some of the previous radio shows, we’ve turned them into podcasts. Go to my website [alaskatopagent.com](https://www.alaskatopagent.com/){: target="_blank"}, scroll down, and about halfway down the page you’ll see the radio show. There are a bunch of different subjects we’ve already discussed available. I have a lender that comes on every other week and we talk about what’s going on in the local economy, different loan programs, and so on. **It’s excellent information for listeners out there thinking about getting into real estate.&nbsp;**

Also, if you’re considering refinancing, now is a wonderful time because interest rates have dropped. If you’re thinking of buying, selling, or refinancing, please feel free to give me a call. I would love to help you\!&nbsp;
