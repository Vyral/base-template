Against the backdrop of our challenging market right now, I’ve been asked this question time and time again: How do I buy and sell a home at the same time?&nbsp;

Today I’ll go through a few steps that should be helpful for those looking to sell their current home and buy a new one all at once.&nbsp;

Before you do anything else, you need to obtain a pre-approval letter from a lender, which will allow for your budget to come into focus. Without one, you won’t know exactly what you can afford. It’s also a must-have once you find the right home. When that happens, you’ll need to show the seller your pre-approval letter to demonstrate the strength of your offer.&nbsp;

Secondly, get your home on the market immediately to advance your position and draw prospective buyers’ eyes to your property.&nbsp;

Starting from the time you find the home you’re most interested in, there are three approaches you can take:&nbsp;

<br>Buy your next house first and sell your current one later. &nbsp;<br>Sell your home outright, find temporary housing, then buy your new home.<br>Close on your current home and purchase your next simultaneously.

<br>There’s a chance you’ll have to include a contingent sale clause in your contract with the seller, and they might ask for a concession known as an escape clause. This gives that particular seller an out in the event that they receive another offer that doesn’t come with a contingency clause.&nbsp;

To help that along, one loan product you can speak about with a lender is a bridge loan, wherein you’re able to take the equity out of your current home and purchase another under a blanket, interest-only loan. Be sure to contact me if you’d like more information on this.&nbsp;

For any other questions related to today’s topic, bridge loans, or anything else with regard to real estate, please reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon\!&nbsp;
