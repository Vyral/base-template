{% include youtube.html %}A lot of people travel during the holiday season, so today, we’re here with the top five tips to keep your home safe while you’re away.

1. Implement new technology. WiFi doorbells are becoming more and more popular these days. That’s because they send notifications to your smartphone whenever someone is at your front door. Even if you are lounging at the beach, you will be able to see who is trying to get into your home. Many of these doorbells take video recordings as well.

2. Let your neighbors know that you’ll be gone. Tell some of your trusted neighbors that you’re going out of town so they can keep an eye on your house while you travel.

3. Use exterior lighting. Motion-activated light systems are inexpensive and will make it seem like someone is home. Exterior lighting keeps thieves away from your house because they don’t want to be seen breaking in.{% include pullquote.html %}4. Put your mail and your newspaper on hold. If your mail starts to pile up and there is a stack of newspapers on your porch, that makes your home an easy target for thieves. Hop online and put your mail on hold or ask a neighbor to collect your papers to protect your property.

5. Lock your doors and windows. This may sound silly, but 30% of break-ins are not forced entry. That means someone left a back door or first-level window open, allowing easy access for thieves. Triple check that you have everything locked up before you leave.

If you follow these five tips, your home will be safe this holiday season. If you have any other questions about home security or about the holiday real estate market, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
