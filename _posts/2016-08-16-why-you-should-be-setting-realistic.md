Today I’d like to talk to you about setting a realistic budget.

Just because the bank pre-qualifies you for a certain amount of money doesn’t mean that you can afford to make that payment every month. Before hitting the streets for a house hunt, you should sit down and make a monthly budget of your expenses. Calculate a number that you are comfortable with spending on your mortgage payment, and work from there.

A quick and easy way to do this is to make sure that you are not spending more than one-third of your gross income on your house. If you spend more than this amount on the house, you risk becoming “house poor,” meaning that you barely have enough money to pay for your house and not enough for much else.

It’s also a good idea to keep six to nine months of mortgage payments in the bank, plus a little extra for any repairs that you might need to make. Most Americans don’t even have one month’s payment in savings, so if you’re able to do this, you’ll be in very exclusive company.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation. We’d be happy to help you.
