Buyers and sellers: today is for you. We’ll be discussing some tips and advice on how to set you up for success in the spring market.

**1. Know the market.** It’s essential to work with professionals and experts in the industry to know how to make a good offer on a home and how to know where to find the homes on time. Right now, we’re seeing lower inventory and fast offers, so both buyers and sellers will have to be on their feet.

**2. Get started early.** With so much competition in the market, being proactive will set you up for success. For a buyer, that might mean meeting with a lender or a credit counselor to be sure that you can get pre-approved. You’ll need to be pre-approved if you want an offer to be accepted. Sellers will have a few more details to take care of, but we can give you a quick idea of what you can get for your home and advice about how to prepare your home to list.

**3. Know your resources.** Sometimes the hottest new real estate websites get it wrong. We are happy to remove the middleman and connect you with new listings as they hit the market. We’ll help you be the first buyer through the door so that you can get that property.

Additionally, we have great resources you can use to help improve your credit and give you a better idea about what you need to do to improve your buying power. For sellers, we can be a resource for you if you have questions about remodeling, home improvements, and design. We can help you boost the value of your home and ensure that you get top dollar.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

PS: I’m entering my 10th year in real estate, and I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you. Last year, we helped nearly 100 families find homes, and we long forward to doing it again this year. Thank you so much for trusting me with your home ownership journey.
