As a seller, there are several mistakes you should avoid in order to be successful in your transaction. Today, I will be sharing some of the biggest and most common seller mistakes.

**1. Not improving the home.** Certain inexpensive changes can improve a seller’s chance of netting more money. When a seller fails to make these changes, they are doing themselves a disservice. Giving the interior of a home a fresh, neutral coat of paint is one of these changes. When a buyer walks in, they are going to notice these small details.

<br>**2. Not decluttering the home.&nbsp;**When a buyer sees your listing online, they will be expecting their in-person visit to reflect what they saw in the photos. Both for photos and for in-person showings, sellers should declutter their home so as to make it look spacious and clean.

<br>**3. Not being prepared for showings.** Homes that go onto the market often start being shown from the very first day. It is critically important that your property is ready for these showings before you list.

<br>**4. Getting too emotional about the house.** It’s natural to feel attached to your home. However, it’s important not to let these emotions get in the way when it comes time to sell. Think of your property as a product you’re selling, not as your home.

<br>**5. Hiring the wrong agent.** Many sellers will hire the first agent they come across. This can be a big mistake. I actually recommend you interview two or three different agents before making your decision so that you have a better understanding of who will do the best job for your needs. Hire someone who you are comfortable with and who has a proven, repeatable track record of success.

These are just a few mistakes my team and I often see. If you would like to learn more, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
