Hey everyone, thanks for joining us once again. Today we want to discuss a question we get a lot from clients: **Why should I sell my house now vs. waiting for the spring or summer to make a move?**&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

There are a lot of reasons you should consider selling now instead of in a few months. Today we are going to give you our top 5, so you can make a decision before your grass gets green and the spring is in full swing.&nbsp;

**1. The transfer market is extremely active**<br>This is the time of year that people who were offered jobs at the end of 2014 are looking for homes to move into, and they won't want to wait until summer to buy your home. **They are in the market for a home right now, and are desperate to get a good home.**<br>&nbsp;

**2. You can change the closing date**<br>When you sell your home in the early months of the year, you can delay your closing date until the summer. By the time your home goes through the entire closing process, it will be late spring or early summer, so you won't be rushed to find a new home right away.

**3. Homes are selling every day**<br>In the last 60 days alone, over 1,300 single-family homes have sold in the Metro Area. The Roth Team has sold over 55 of those homes by ourselves.&nbsp;

**4. Buyers have fewer options**<br>Inventory is very low right now, and buyers are gobbling up the best homes almost as soon as they come on the market. **Right now, there is a 25% deficit in inventory from where we usually are at, and the demand has only increased so far**.<br>&nbsp;

**5. Interest rates will rise soon**<br>Right now is the perfect time to take advantage of our low interest rates. Instead of waiting until later in the year and having to deal with 5-6% interest rates, **you can secure an interest rate right now between 3% and 4%**, saving you tens of thousands in interest over the life of your loan.
