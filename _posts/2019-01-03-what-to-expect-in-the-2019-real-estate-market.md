Today we’ll be looking at what we’ll be expecting in 2019 for interest rates and home appreciation in Salt Lake County.

We’re currently seeing interest rates of about 4.5% for a 30-year conventional mortgage. **Economists believe we’ll be somewhere around 5.5% by the end of the year.**

The average home price in our county is $350,000. Let’s calculate what the projected 1% rate hike would mean for a mortgage of this price. At 4.5%, a $350,000 loan will cost $1,773 a month for principal and interest. At 5.5%, this same loan would cost $1,987 a month—a $214 difference.

Home appreciation has been in the double digits for the last few years, but this isn’t the case now. We’re seeing things begin to flatten out—this is good for the real estate market, but we won’t be experiencing the same multiple-offer situations we did in the past. Homes may also take longer to sell. We’re looking at a 4% increase in home values this year, which would bring the median price of $350,000 to about $365,000 in 2020.

**If we’re expecting rising interest rates and rising appreciation, what does this mean when buying a home?**

If you qualify for a $350,000 mortgage now and interest rates increase 1% (and there are no changes to your income, credit, etc.), you’ll then qualify for only $312,000. Because prices will appreciate over the next year, you’d make money if you bought a home soon—a $300,000 home bought now would be worth $312,000 next year. But, when interest rates rise, **many homes could suddenly be out of your price range.**
