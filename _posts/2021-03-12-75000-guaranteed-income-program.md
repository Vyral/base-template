<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how our team’s $75,000 guaranteed income program works.</em></p>

Here on the Dave Hooke Team, we know there is a lot of confusion in the marketplace when people start talking about commission splits and fees. We want to cut to the chase because what’s most important to us is how much we’re taking home before taxes to serve our families. Real estate can be super inconsistent with income, so we want to put our money where our mouth is. Joining our team means that you’ll make at least $75,000 per year, or we’ll pay the difference.

How do we do that? There are two steps:

**1\. We make sure our agents are trained to generate eight transactions per year on their own.** With our new model, they get paid handsomely with higher commission splits.

**2\. Our appointment setting team puts two new appointments in their calendar every week.** All agents need to do is show up and do a great job for their clients.

If you want to learn more, send me a private message with “$75,000 guarantee” or type it in the comments below, and I’ll tell you all about it. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you.
