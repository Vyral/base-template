In today’s tight market, you might have to show four or five properties in an afternoon. That’s a lot of work. I just wanted to offer a few questions and comments for you to ponder before you go ahead and schedule your next home showing tour.

The first thing to think about is how much time you need for each property. It will depend on the size, location, and uniqueness of the home.

**Another thing to ponder is how you should approach the neighborhood.** Use what you’ve found out about your buyer and what’s important to them when planning the tour. Use Google Maps to plug in our addresses so you can plan a good route. Use the route to show amenities in the neighborhood or how easy it is to jump on the freeway.

There are two schools of thought when it comes to how you should handle showing the best prospective property to your client. Some people say that you should show it first. Others say you should show it last. In our experience, **most buyers want to feel like they’ve been able to shop around at least a little bit.** Therefore, they are more hesitant to make an offer on the first home they see. I would keep that in mind when planning your tour.

Communicating with listing agents is another skill you'll have to have. Chances are that you have to make an appointment to see most of these properties. **Many of them require notice at least 24 hours in advance, too.**

Finally, be thoughtful of the emotional reaction your client may have when approaching the property. They’re not just buying sticks and bricks, they’re buying a home. You’ve got to give them enough time to experience the feeling of home.

I hope you found these tips helpful. If you have any questions for me at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
