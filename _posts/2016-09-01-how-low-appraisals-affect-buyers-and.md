Whether you are or buying or selling a home, an appraisal is an important part of the transaction for you. So what happens if the appraisal comes in low?

There are basically three things that can happen:

**1. You can challenge the appraisal.** Reach out to the lender and tell them that you think it's inaccurate or that they've missed something important. If the lender allows a challenge, you can give them some data or information that shows that the homeâ€™s value is higher than what they've deemed it to be.

**2.Negotiation.** If the difference between the asking price and the appraisal is $10,000, for example, the buyer and seller can negotiate that difference. There will typically be a more aggressive negotiation from the seller than the buyer. If the seller agrees to come down $7,000, the buyer will need to come up with an additional $3,000 to make up the difference. There are plenty of options for this. The seller could come down the full $10,000 or the buyer could come up and cover the full $10,000 in cash. It depends on the motivations of the buyer and seller and the market conditions, among other things.

**3. The deal dies.** You basically just cancel the deal if the buyer and seller can't come to terms in the negotiation.

Hopefully this situation doesn't happen to you as a buyer or seller, but I hope this topic was helpful for you. If you have a low appraisal, always consult your real estate advisor for help to work through it the best way possible.
