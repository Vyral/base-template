We all know that it’s important for a homebuyer to use a licensed real estate agent when buying a home. But do you know why? Today I will share three of the top reasons.&nbsp;

**1. We have the inventory.** As real estate professionals, we have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database for Realtors. Of course, there are other websites out there that list houses for sale, but we all know that the MLS is the most up-to-date database for listings. Buyers who look for homes on other websites will only to be disappointed to find out they're not available.

And, if we do not have the inventory, we have the tools and technologies and databases to help find you a home that fits all of your needs.

**2. We have the negotiation skills.** As a homebuyer, you may be hesitant to speak your mind on certain points, for fear of offending the seller.

With an agent on your side, you will get the best deal and terms, you will know what is normal, and you will know what to expect. We will keep you up-to-date on timelines to make sure that you do not miss out on an opportunity for inspections or appraisals.

**3. A buyer agent is free.** When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agent’s compensation. There is no reason for you to do all of the work when you can use us. We can help you negotiate your best terms, hold the deal together to get you to closing on time, and provide you with all of our years of experience for free!

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying, please feel free to call me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
