Today I want to give you a few tips about where to have a great staycation here in Charleston. <strong>I am actually on a staycation right now at the Wild Dunes Resort on the Isle of Palms.</strong>

There is so much to do here. My family loves to play tennis, play golf on one of the beautiful golf courses here, and my girls love to dance to the live music that is here every night from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.

<strong>The beach is wonderful here, as are the family game nights.</strong> If you are looking for a staycation or just a regular vacation, this is a great spot to choose.
