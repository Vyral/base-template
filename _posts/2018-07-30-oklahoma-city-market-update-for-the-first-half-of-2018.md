Today I’ve got a quick market update for you for the first half of 2018. The numbers are in and we’ve got great news.

The Oklahoma City metro market is strong. New listings are up by 8.7%, which means more homeowners are listing their homes. New pending sales are also up 7.8%, which tells us that the market is ready for the increased supply and buyers are buying those homes up. Closed sales are up by 4.3%, which is also following that same trend.

**Here are a few more statistics that show how our market is seeing positive movement this summer:**

* Our days on market is down 5%
* Our average sales price is up 3%
* Our median sales price is up 2.1%

**When you put all those numbers together, you can see that we are still in a strong seller’s market** with a 3.7-month supply of inventory. If you’ve been thinking about selling your home this year, now is a great time to do that.

If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
