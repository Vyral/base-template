{% include youtube.html %}If you haven't received fresh quotes for your homeowners insurance or reviewed your policy with your provider in the last year, you need to do it right away.

<br>After Katrina, rates skyrocketed on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and most homeowners were forced into the state wind pool. However, vendors have moved back into the market in recent years, driving competition up and rates down. We've even seen cases of rates getting cut in half as people come out of the wind pool and back into private coverage.

Too often though, I see homeowners paying insurance that's way over what they need to pay. I even recently met with someone paying $3,400 dollars with a big provider, but after they got some quotes from local providers, they were shocked to see most of the estimates come in below $1,800.

If your vendor hasn't contacted your for more than a year and your policy is simply on autopilot, that might be another reason to seek another vendor. They're not working for you; they're just taking your money.

If you have any questions or you're thinking of buying or selling a home in the area, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
