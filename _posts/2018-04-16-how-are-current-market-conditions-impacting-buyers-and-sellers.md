What’s the latest news for buyers and sellers in our market?

To answer that, let’s first compare some year-over-year numbers from March 2017 to March 2018. Between those two time periods, the number of closed sales decreased 22%, dropping from 460 in March 2017 to 357 last month. The average days on market dropped as well, but only from 58 days in March 2017 to 54 days in March 2018.

Currently, inventory remains low—there were only 687 homes that were listed last March. Because inventory is so low, March 2018 saw a 19% hike in home values compared to March 2017. So, **in addition to inventory being low, prices continue to rise.**

Interest rates are still at 40-year lows, starting at about 4.375% and rising depending on your home purchase and specific situation.

What does this mean for buyers and sellers?

Like I said, inventory is tight. Banks are getting very aggressive with their prices for short sales and bank-owned properties, and there are still a lot of multiple bid scenarios happening with hot properties. For buyers, in addition to the low interest rates, there are a lot of new construction projects popping up with great incentives and other off-market opportunities available out there.

In general, **our market is looking strong, and there are a lot of great opportunities for buyers and sellers**.
