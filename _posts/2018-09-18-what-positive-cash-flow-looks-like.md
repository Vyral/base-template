To give you an example of how rental income properties are used to generate positive cash flow, I’ll tell you about a situation I came across recently.

This situation involved a family who owned a home for two years and then decided they wanted to buy another one. The mortgage payment for their first home was approximately $1,400 a month, so they converted their current home into a rental home and found a tenant who was willing to pay them $1,900 a month in rent.

Now, they have $500 of positive cash flow per month. They can take that extra $500 and pay down more principal on their current home or apply it toward their next mortgage, which is normally more expensive, but now their transition will be much easier.

It’s a beautiful thing, really—**they have two homes that are appreciating in this hot market, and their renter is completely paying off one of their mortgages and partially paying off the other.**

If you’re thinking about investing in real estate and doing the same thing or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
