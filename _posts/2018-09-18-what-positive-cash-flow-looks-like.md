  Positive cash flow typically refers to rental income properties. Here’s an
  example of what i’m talking about.

I recently encountered a family who had owned a home for two years before deciding they wanted to buy another one. The mortgage payment for their first home was approximately $1,400 a month, so instead of selling it, they converted it into a rental home and found a tenant who was willing to pay them $1,900 a month in rent

Now, they have $500 of positive cash flow per month. They can take that extra $500 and pay down more principal on their current home or apply it toward their next mortgage, which is normally more expensive, but now their transition will be much easier.

It’s a beautiful thing, really—**they have two homes that are appreciating in this hot market, and their renter is completely paying off one of their mortgages and partially paying off the other.**

If you’re thinking about investing in real estate and doing the same thing or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
