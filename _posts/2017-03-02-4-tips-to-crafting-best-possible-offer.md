If you’ve found the perfect home and you’re ready to make an offer, here are four tips to make your offer stand out and ensure that you get that perfect home.

First, understand what you can afford. Work with a well-known lender who’s highly qualified so they can make you look as solid as possible on paper. You also want to know from them what your big-picture financial situation looks like so you can know what loan programs are available and you can prepare for any future updates or repairs on the home.

Secondly, act fast. A balanced market is considered to have six months’ worth of inventory. In Portland, we have 1.3 months’ worth of inventory. Our market is very competitive, so once you find a home, you must move forward under the guidance of your agent as quickly as possible.

Third, make sure your offer is solid. Don’t make a lowball offer. Instead, have your agent look through a list of comparable properties in the area and what they have sold for so you can make a good offer. Another thing you could do is write a letter to the seller telling them all about you, your family, what you plan to do with the home, and any other information of that type that might ingratiate yourself to them. You could also have your agent dig further into the motivations of the seller to find out if there is some need of theirs that you can satisfy.

Finally, be prepared to negotiate. After you submit an offer, you will probably receive a counter offer, and you need to be prepared to respond. This is another instance where being pre-approved up front is crucial—you know that if you have to raise your price a little bit, you can.
