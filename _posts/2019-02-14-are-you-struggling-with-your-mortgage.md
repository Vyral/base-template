  Low oil prices are affecting many people in our area, but there are ways to
  make it through the hard times. If you or someone you know is facing
  foreclosure, you don’t need to give in and let the banks take over. Instead,
  you can borrow from your 401(k) or use your home’s equity to get you through
  this tough spot. Otherwise, there are ways you can sell your home and still
  receive top dollar. To learn more, watch this short video.

We’ve received multiple calls in the last few months from people who are struggling to pay their mortgages. For some, the threat of foreclosure is looming overhead. **They simply have no idea who to turn to or what to do, so they reach out to us.**

Fortunately, if you or anyone you know is struggling, there are ways you can make it through the hard times. **We have been able to advise those who contacted us about their situations** and give them options such as borrowing from their 401(k) or using their home equity to help pay bills in the meantime.

Low oil prices are affecting the Houston area, so many people are simply trying to hold out until these prices rise to a more stable level. If you can’t wait until this happens, don’t let the bank foreclose on your home—you can try to sell it instead. **We’ve been able to help people in this position** sell to investors and use that money to find smaller, more affordable homes.

You don’t have to submit to bank foreclosure. There are many options you have, and we’d be happy to advise you on what would work best in your own situation. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me personally at 832-277-3577. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
