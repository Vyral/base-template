Today I wanted to lend a little clarity about the credit explanation letter our team has probably already sent to you. I don’t want you to worry about it, but I do want you know where the information on it comes from.

All of the information on the letter is pulled from your credit report. For the addresses listed in the letter, **all we really need to know is if you own the property at the address in question.**

If you have a derogatory account on your report, think back to when that/those payment(s) became late and under what circumstances, as well as what your current situation is regarding said account.

If it’s an old late payment, **let us know whether or not you’ve been continually making payments on time since it became late.** If it’s an open collection, let us know if it’s medical or non-medical. We also need to know if you’re actively trying to pay it, or if the bill is being disputed (such as in a case where you believe your insurance company ought to have paid it).

Lastly, though it might seem small, **let us know if your name is misspelled or if the wrong name was used** (such as if your maiden name was used instead of your married name, etc.)<br><br>After all this, simply sign and date the bottom of the letter.

If you have any further questions about this, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
