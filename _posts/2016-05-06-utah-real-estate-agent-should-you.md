**Are pre-sale inspections a good idea or a bad idea?** Can they help you save money? What’s the deal?

This is where a lot of sellers lose money or even their buyers. For instance, if you’ve accepted an offer, **many buyers add a contingency in the contract, which includes a home inspection.** If the inspection comes back with items of concern, that’s another area a buyer can negotiate with you. They might not only want you to fix these repairs but bring down the price of their offer. **It might even deter buyers to withdraw their offer entirely.**

Don’t let this happen to you! We want to put you in charge as a seller. There’s a simple way to take control of the situation before you even list your property in Utah.

By conducting a pre-sale inspection, **you remove inspection-related contingencies from the contract.** This benefits you because it no longer becomes something to negotiate with the buyer. You additionally have the opportunity to **repair those problem areas before you even list your property on the market.** We want you to be comfortable and confident that issues won’t arise after you’ve listed your home.
