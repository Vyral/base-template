Over the last six months, I’ve been sending out videos answering questions that you send in. Today, I wanted to take a little bit of a different approach and update you on where our Building Products practice stands today.

Over the last six to eight months, we have been experiencing a higher hiring demand because of the growth that our clients are experiencing. We found that in order to continue to service you with the quality that we’ve had in the past, we’ve had to add to the team. **As an organization, we have invested a tremendous amount back into the Building Products side.&nbsp;**

Recently we added seven new employees, five of which are executive recruiters and two are full-time internet researchers. These internet researchers are helping fulfil the pipeline needed in order for our clients to continue to receive high quality service from our executive recruiters, and to free up the recruiters to talk to the candidates in the marketplace.

**Each of the executive recruiters on this team reach out to nearly 100 people&nbsp;**each day. Our team is 13 people strong, reaching out to 100 people each every day in this industry. That’s an average of 1300 people each and every day. That enables us to continue to remain dialed in to what’s going on in this industry.

As a reminder, we do specialize with manufacturers and distributors, both in the residential and commercial sides. We also work with interior products as well as exterior products in all types of roles within the organization.&nbsp;

My recommendation is to reach out with one of our consultants. Whether you’re somebody that has a need on a proactive basis or reactive basis, either from a company perspective or on a personal level, call, email, InMail, or just connect with a consultant on LinkedIn so that they can keep you up to speed on what’s happening in the market.&nbsp;

If you have a hiring need that you’d like to discuss, or you’re looking to schedule a career consultation, please give us a call. We’d be happy to help!
