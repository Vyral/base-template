<center>It&rsquo;s time to start building your real estate team, and today I&rsquo;ll share how you can do so.</center>

&nbsp;

Fellow agents, I’ve got an important message: It’s time to start building your real estate team.&nbsp;

Now, you may be thinking, “I don’t have enough experience\!” or “I don’t have the resources, systems, structures, or leads I need to start and run a team\!” These are common objections to the suggestion that it’s time to build a team, but **before you discount the option entirely, allow me to share some insight into why I believe you should give it a shot.&nbsp;**

Despite what you might have heard, building a team is a great idea at any point in your career—even if it’s your very first day. When you operate as a solo agent, there are a lot of limitations on the amount of money you can earn and the amount of free time you can enjoy with this career. Not only are solo agents spread thin across myriad tasks, but they’re also less likely to bring in the kind of income they could by working on (or by running) a real estate team.&nbsp;

By leveraging the time and talent of other agents, your potential to grow your income becomes limitless. A well-structured team can even allow you to start earning passive income. And, as I already mentioned, having a team will also give you a lot more free time.&nbsp;

So, with these points in mind, starting a team is a no-brainer. Who wouldn’t want to improve their work/life balance all while growing their income?&nbsp;

**Of course, there’s still the matter of those objections that probably came to mind when I first introduced this message.&nbsp;**

This is where Abby Realty comes in. The environment at our brokerage was specifically designed to allow teams to thrive. We have lead generation systems you can plug into without breaking the bank. Each lead costs less than $5, and since very few agents need more than 20 to 30 leads per month, this means you could successfully bring in all the leads you need for just $100 to $150 per month. This is incredibly inexpensive.

As for training, we’ve also got things covered. We offer training classes five days a week, all of which will help your agents become experts in every area of the industry.&nbsp;

We’ve got systems and structures taken care of, as well.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that we’re here to support your future. **When you work through us, building a real estate team is a true “plug-and-play” affair.&nbsp;**

So what are you waiting for? Let’s have a conversation about your career.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
