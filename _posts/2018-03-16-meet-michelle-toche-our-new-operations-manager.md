Michelle is excited and charged to dive into helping us with the organization on the operations side of the business as my right-hand gal. As a result, **she’ll help me be able to stay even closer in touch with you all,** not to mention helping us organize a few upcoming client events. We’ve got a couple really fun plans in the works.

The Wicker Homes Group is **very excited to be serving you at an even higher level.**Stay tuned for all sorts of developments as we continue to progress through the wonderful year of 2018.

If you have any questions or need any help, give me a shout. I’d love to help.
