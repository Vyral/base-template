<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what home sellers should know before they decide to sell.</em></center>

<br>Real estate is hot here in Tulsa and homes are flying off the market. However, before you make the decision to sell, I want to ask you some questions to understand how to best help you with your real estate needs.

**My first question: Were you already thinking about making a move this spring or summer?** The market has really heated up over the last few weeks, but since we were deemed essential here in Tulsa, we’ve been set up and working our systems virtually to help buyers and sellers this whole time.

The reason I know the market is hot is because last weekend, we had two listings go on the market, nab multiple offers, and sell for $10,000 over their list prices. This shows that demand remains very high, especially for desirable homes in desirable price ranges.

**The next question I’d ask: What’s your timeline?** Due to new regulations, some lenders may need extra paperwork and details from borrowers before a loan is approved. The great thing about working with a team selling a lot of homes is that we’re on top of it and have plans to help you through the process.

We’re also watching and monitoring the real estate market every day. As a team, **we keep a close eye on homes that come on the market, homes that sell, and homes that come off the market for whatever reason**. This really gives us the pulse of the local Tulsa market and helps us serve our clients better and help them achieve their real estate goals.

If buying or selling is something you have in mind but you’re still a little nervous about starting the process, don’t hesitate to reach out to us to learn more about how we can help you buy or sell safely or even virtually.

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
