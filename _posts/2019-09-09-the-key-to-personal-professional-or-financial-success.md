<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A lot of great things have happened in our market and in my life lately, and, in today’s message, I want to explain how you can find similar success.</em></p>

2019 has been full of exciting changes and developments. On a personal level, I was lucky enough to be named the No. 1 social media marketing expert among all Realtors in the Capital Region. As for our Albany area market, in general, the market is still hot—unlike our fall weather.&nbsp;

**Mortgage rates are a full percentage point below what they were a year ago, which gives buyers a massive amount of purchasing power.** You can currently lock in a 30-year mortgage in the mid 3% range, so it’s a great time to make a move if you’ve been thinking of doing so. And because buyer interest is so high right now, sellers will also find our current market to be rife with opportunity.&nbsp;

With this quick update out of the way, I’d like to circle back to the award I mentioned earlier and thank you for helping me receive it. Without your business and support, it wouldn’t have been possible. The most exciting thing about this award is that it represents my team’s ability to utilize social media marketing at a higher level than any other team in our region. So if you want to know how we can put our award-winning marketing plan to work for you, please reach out.

Of course, my team and I are always happy to help you achieve success on a personal level, too—not just in regards to your real estate goals. That's why I’d like to share some interesting information I recently learned about retirement saving trends in the United States. According to a survey by Edward Jones, **only 51% of Americans contribute to a 401(k) account, and only 37% contribute to an individual retirement account.&nbsp;**

As someone who has always tried my best to put away money for my future, even from a young age, this pains me to know—especially because 401(k) accounts are some of the easiest ways to build long-term wealth. In fact, properly utilizing a 401(k) could even help you to become a millionaire.

Success in any form takes time. As much as we’d all like to become wealthy, lose weight, or land our dream job overnight, it takes time to reap the rewards of our efforts. This is something I’ve learned not only through my career as an agent, but also through my time as a runner. Good or bad, our daily habits add up. If I run every day, for example, I’ll slowly improve. If I start skipping exercise and eating a donut every day, though, I’ll eventually lose progress on my fitness journey.&nbsp;

The same principle holds true when it comes to building wealth. **Whether you want to just lead a comfortable lifestyle after retirement or you want to become a millionaire, you need to start taking small steps toward that goal right now.** Every little bit counts.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about anything in today’s message, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
