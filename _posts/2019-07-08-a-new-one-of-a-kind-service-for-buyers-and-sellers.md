For the last year, we’ve been testing new, innovative ways to market properties, and we’ve found that selling them through online auctions is one of the best avenues to do this. &nbsp;

With that said, **we’re announcing the official launch of our own auction platform**, which will cater to motivated sellers who’d like to sell their fixer-upper quickly and a little under market value to interested buyers who are looking to take on an investment opportunity.&nbsp;

The idea behind this new platform is to maximize value for both sellers and buyers. **For those looking to sell as is, your home will garner attention from thousands of investors, rather than only receiving a handful of offers via the traditional way.**

This way, you’ll receive multiple offers, which will elevate your home’s price and keep you from leaving money on the table.&nbsp;

**As for buyers, our platform will provide numerous opportunities to purchase fix-and-flip properties, hold investments, and other hidden gems that you won’t find on the MLS or anywhere else online.&nbsp;**

For more information, go ahead and visit our website [here](http://arizonarealtyauction.com/){: target="_blank"}. We’d love to hear your feedback. If you're a seller interested in selling your property as is, we’d be happy to introduce you to the platform and show you how it works.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer looking to invest in a discounted property, please give us a call as well. We look forward to hearing from you soon\!
