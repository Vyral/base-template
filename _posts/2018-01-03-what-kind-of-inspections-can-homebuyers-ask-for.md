Sometimes we work with buyers who are unsure of what to look for and what repairs they should and shouldn’t ask for during the home inspection period. There are three different types of repairs you should know about, but not all of them are worth asking for.

**First, don’t ask for the “Mickey Mouse repair”** from the seller, especially if the home is a resale home or it’s advanced in age. A “Mickey Mouse repair” is like asking to fix a loose doorknob or repainting the bathroom because you didn’t like its color. Most sellers in our marketplace won’t take care of those types of items for you, so don’t bother asking.

Next are moderate repairs, which you may be able to ask for. These are things you might not have noticed during the first walk-through, like a window that’s foggy or doesn’t quite work. Moderate repairs don’t qualify as a safety issue, but depending on the situation, you may be able to ask for them.

Finally, **you should definitely ask for repairs on health and safety-related issues.** Inspectors will look for things like cracked heat exchangers or leaks in the roof, and these are items you absolutely want to go back and ask the seller to repair, replace, or compensate you for.

Stay tuned for my next video where I’ll answer how you can pay for these repairs. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
