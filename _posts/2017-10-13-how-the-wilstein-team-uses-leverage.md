It’s time for part two of The Leverage Series, which explores how building a business with a team might work for you.

Today I’m talking to The Wilstein Team. First, let’s meet Ron Wilstein and Doug Almstedt and see what they have to say.

**Ron, you’ve had some version of a team for the 25 years I’ve known you. What prompted you to bring leverage into your business way back when?**

Ron: I received some good advice from someone who said, “There’s a lot involved in real estate. There are a lot of things you have to do and if you’re doing all of it, then you’re spending a lot of time doing that and not working with buyers and sellers.”

So they basically said that if you can hire someone at a lower wage than your earning power to take care of those tasks that are important, that will put you in front of more buyers and sellers. That is how I know the importance of leverage.

**You’ve owned your own brokerage for 10 years. When you decided to get out of running the broker’s side of the world and just focus on the business, why did you choose to move to Keller Williams?**

Ron: I looked at a number of different, well-respected brokerages in town and they each had their strengths, but I found Keller Williams to be the best combination in part because I do my own distinct marketing. The Keller Williams environment, or culture, allows agents to express and conduct their business in the ways that they want rather than following a cookie cutter mold from a franchise. So, it gave me the greatest amount of latitude to help me be successful and the move was very well-suited for my team members because, frankly, they get better commission splits than the other brokerages allow.

**Please tell me about the composition of your team.**

Ron: Our team consists of seven members. I am the team leader, and I typically specialize in representing sellers. Doug and I represent sellers, and then we have three buyer’s agents: Dean, Kathy, and Jeremy. Then we have the admin team, Lynette Thorn and Jennifer Lee. Lynette’s been with me 22 years and Jennifer has been with us for 12 years. Jennifer is our transaction coordinator and interacts with buyers and sellers. If you want a fast answer, talk to Jennifer. Lynette has done every job in the business and now handles the marketing while overseeing the entire team.

**Doug, how long have you been on the team and how has being on a team changed your life?**

Doug: I was able to join Ron about four years ago. His team has been an immeasurable help. Going from an independent agent trying to do it all myself and joining Ron’s team with established procedures and a team that takes care of everything has increased my business and give me a lot more free time. I’m a cyclist, so it’s been nice to have more time to train and do the races that I want to be in each year. It’s been extremely beneficial.

**You’re also now a director for the Park City Board of Realtors. Congratulations!**

Doug: I am! So, boss, I may need a little more time.

Ron: We have a political giant on our team, so this is a good thing.

Doug: I am excited to serve on the board of directors for the Park City Board of Realtors.

**After I met with Doug and Ron, I decided to sit down with the real heart of the organization: the admin team. Jennifer Lee and Lynette Thorn play very important roles on the Wilstein Team, and they took time out of their busy days to answer a few of my questions.**

**Jen, I understand that you’ve been with Ron for 12 years as client care and transaction manager. What does that involve?**

Jen: My job is to manage all of the paperwork, all of the people, and all of the deadlines.

On the seller side, I am the main point of contact for our clients. They can call me with any questions and I can usually get an answer to them more quickly than the agent can. I manage all of the paperwork and make sure everything's signed and distributed properly. I also help Lynette with the marketing schedule and handle all of the showings on our properties.

That includes receiving inquiries from the buyer’s agent, coordinating that appointment with the sellers, and follow up on every showing to get feedback so that we can report back to the seller so that they know what’s going on.

On the buyer side, I make sure the paperwork is submitted to the lender and the title company. I also coordinate the inspection, the appraisal, and serve as the main point of contact for the buyer or buyer’s agent.

One thing that keeps us on the same page is that we all use a shared calendar so that I can see what everyone is doing, make sure everything happens as it should, and get us to the closing table with paperwork completed and done.

**Well, we know that leads to very satisfied clients. Jen, thank you for all of your hard work. Lynette, tell us about the marketing side of the team. How long have you been working with Ron?**

Lynette: I think it’s going to be 21 years in January. I do work on the marketing side of the team. One of my goals is to have no prospect left behind. I try to get contact info from our agents on all of their prospects. Sometimes I have to beg, borrow, or steal from agents or other sources to get people into our database so we can start disseminating information to them, whether it be an update on a new listing, our newsletter, or the postcards that we send to different neighborhoods.

I also keep multiple websites updated with current information and add pages to them so our viewers can have the most recent information available. We also send out hard copies of our newsletters, flyers, magazines, and postcards. I coordinate with Ron on getting those edited, printed, and mailed out. We try to keep them going on systematic calendar.

**Next, I’d like to introduce  you to two of the three buyer’s agents on The Wilstein Team: Kathy Leitzke and Dean Deleone.**

**Kathy, you joined the team a few years back. How has being a buyer’s agent on a team changed your life?**

Kathy: Joining the team allowed me to focus on my clients and my client’s needs. My team takes care of marketing and our web presence, which frees me up to focus on what I like best.

**Dean, I know you had the good fortune of starting with the Wilstein team right out of business school. I know you had sales experience prior to this in another industry. How has that worked out for you?**

Dean: As Kathy mentioned, we have multiple websites that instantly get leads going. I don’t have to market and search for those leads. My past experience means I’m able to cultivate those leads and really hit the ground running, so it’s been a great experience.

**Finally, Jeremy Wilstein sent in a video with some comments on working on a team as a buyer’s agent.**

Jeremey: The support of The Wilstein team has allowed me to pursue my love of real estate while simultaneously pursuing my love of adventure and travel. Without a doubt, I would not be able to do what I’m doing without the support of my team: my father, Ron; Jennifer; Lynette, Doug, Kathy, and Dean.

While traveling, I’ve been able to farm and stay in contact with all of my clients that I’ve developed over the last six or seven years, when I worked full-time in real estate. I’m still able to keep those relationships but if I’m not in town, they can go out and look at a property with another agent on our team. It’s been tremendous for me to continue my real estate business while continuing this love of travel and adventure and not wait until I’m older to experience it in life.
