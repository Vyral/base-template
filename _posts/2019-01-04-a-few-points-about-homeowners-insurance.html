Today I’m delighted to be joined by Millie Vickovic of Farmer’s Insurance to talk a little bit about homeowners insurance and more.

**When it comes to homeowners insurance, having the correct policy is key.** It should be a policy that, in the event of a disaster, allows you to rebuild your house, replace your personal property, and protect your assets in case of a liability claim.

**When you open escrow on a home purchase, you need to have proof of insurance in a timely manner so that the transaction closes on time.** Millie and her team work out of Glendale and have always done a great job for us and our clients.

If you have any questions for Millie about insurance or for myself about real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
