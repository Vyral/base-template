There are a lot of variables to think about when considering replacing a carpet and whether it will give you the best bang for your buck.

As a seller, **it depends on the price point you want to hit**. A different tactic we use sometimes for our sellers is to have them provide their buyer an allowance for flooring. Oftentimes, the replacement carpet you pick might not be the type the buyer wants. They might not even want carpeting—they might prefer hardwood instead.

Besides offering a carpet allowance, you can also offer to reduce your home’s price by however much it would cost to replace the carpet.
