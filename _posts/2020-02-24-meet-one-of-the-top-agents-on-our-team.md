Derek Savoy originally grew up in Northwest Connecticut before moving to South Carolina at the age of 18. In addition to being a licensed real estate and insurance agent, he’s also a notary and has a background in finance working with Marie Max.

When he came to Clarksville, Tennessee, in December 2019, he decided that **real estate was going to be his lifelong career,** and now looks forward to what the Clarksville market has in store.&nbsp;

Speaking of which, our market is really heating up\! We have a shortage of inventory and most buyers can expect multiple-offer situations when they bid on a home. Derek notes that Columbia’s market is actually very similar to Clarksville’s in these ways. Columbia’s a military city, so Derek is accustomed to people frequently moving to and from the area; rentals are a big market there. As such, there has been a big spike in the cost of rents.

A fun fact about Derek: He participates in triathlons as one of his hobbies. He has a background running track and cross-country in high school and was involved in gymnastics growing up. This is something else that he has in common with the Air Assault Team: **We either participate or sponsor several local running events.** Here on the team, we love different types of challenges and live by the “work hard, play hard” philosophy.

If you don’t already have a top agent who knows how to navigate a heated market, the Air Assault Team has the tools to help you. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions you have.
