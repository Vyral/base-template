To help guide our sellers and buyers in making the best decisions, we're constantly listening to economists and trying to stay ahead of the market. However, **some of our sellers have been reacting hastily, which is not ideal** despite some experts recommending offensive offers as a tactic. That’s why today we’ll discuss some ways for you to make real estate decisions based on logic and not just on emotions. We'll also share stories of clients who trusted us and how it went.

Some of the offers we've received, where the seller listened to us and trusted our guidance, have resulted in successful sales. For instance, one client received an offer that wasn't quite where they wanted it to be, but since we had already discussed market conditions and expectations in our listing agreement, they decided to accept the offer. This resulted in a successful sale, and the client has since moved out of state, sending us a grateful text. However, some clients still hold the belief that the first offer should always be rejected, which is not necessarily the best approach and could be detrimental in the long run.

Every client deserves a counter or a response, so let's **avoid getting caught up in an emotional, offensive state of mind**. When gurus say to make the offensive offer, they don't expect you to accept it as is. Rather, they hope to meet somewhere in the middle.
