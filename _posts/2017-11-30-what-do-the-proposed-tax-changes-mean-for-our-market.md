Recently, I’ve been getting a ton of questions about how Washington’s proposed tax changes might impact the real estate market.

This question is too complex to be tackled at once, so be on the lookout for future installments on this topic.

For today, let’s start by talking about the mortgage interest tax deduction. Right now, we can deduct the interest we pay on a mortgage up to $1.1 million.

However, **the proposed tax plan would only allow these tax deductions up to a $500,000 mortgage.**

Most mortgages in our area aren’t above $500,000, so this won’t have a huge impact on our local market. However, markets in Seattle or San Francisco where the average prices are much higher will see a more significant effect.

**If you closed on a home before November 2, these changes will not apply to you. You will be grandfathered in.**

An important note to remember is that this is not the final tax plan, it is just a proposal. So, these rules could change before the plan actually goes through.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
