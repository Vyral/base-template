As a property manager, letting a tenant take care of your property’s lawn themselves is a bad idea.

Why? **In all my years in this business, I’ve only seen one or two tenants really take care of a lawn the way a property owner would.** I know you can save a few dollars here and there letting tenants take care of the lawn, but a lot of your property’s value is based on that lawn and how it ties into the overall curb appeal.

If you let someone else take care of this area who has no real interest in doing so, they won’t do as good of a job as a lawn service company. If the lawn service company doesn’t do a good job, you can fire them and hire another company or have them come back and take care of the things they’re supposed to take care of. To keep your property’s lawn in top condition and keep your home’s value high, you need a lawn service company and a good sprinkler system.

As always, if you have questions about this or any property management topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me any way you can. I’d love to speak with you.
