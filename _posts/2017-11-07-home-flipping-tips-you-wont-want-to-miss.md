Recently, a new top 10 list has come out for the most profitable cities in the US for home flipping.&nbsp;

*[**WalletHub just conducted a 150-city study**](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-to-flip-houses/23158/.)* to get these results, so let’s dive into what they found.

First of all, coastal areas are mostly off-limits for this move. The cost of getting into these areas is generally high, so you might do better in some smaller markets. Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for example, was No. 2 on the list.&nbsp;

**However, one coastal city market did make the top ten list. That city was Tampa**.&nbsp;

But on a more specific scale, location will still matter. You can fix a house up, but you can’t change the neighborhood.&nbsp;

Most people look in lower price points for homes to flip. That being said: don’t overdo it. Going overboard with renovations on a lower-end home will not be worth it. Remember, **there won’t be any TV crew or ribbon cutting ceremony when you put these homes back on the market**.&nbsp;

Look for properties that don’t need more than a single major repair. I recommend skipping over any home that you aren’t truly equipped to take on.&nbsp;

Also, consider renting out properties for a while instead of selling right away. **Rentals are a great way to ride out appreciation**.&nbsp;

When you do sell, though, think about seller financing. This is another great vehicle for you to get some additional cash.

In short, flipping is not for the weak of heart. You need cash, you need to move quickly, and you need to know what you’re doing.
