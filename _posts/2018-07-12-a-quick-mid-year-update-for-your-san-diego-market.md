With half of the year now complete, I have some exciting statistics to share with you regarding our current market. **First, the median home price has increased to $640,000** from $590,000 in January of this year. That is a $50,000 increase from just six months ago.

January of 2017, meanwhile, saw an average median sales price of $550,000. **That is an increase of over 16.3% in the last 18 months.**

With property prices at an all-time high, it is still a great time for sellers to list their home and get it sold for top dollar before the end of summer. Toward the end of the summer, properties will start to stabilize because of increasing interest rates. This will be great for buyers who are currently getting priced out of the market.

If you are interested in listing your home, you should consider us at Select Premier Properties because we offer a 1.5% listing. This means that you can save thousands of dollars without sacrificing service. To learn more, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
