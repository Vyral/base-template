Real estate investing has had a huge impact on my life. It’s helped me to build wealth, support my family, and prepare for the future.&nbsp;

Renting out investment properties is an incredible way to create passive income. Better still, paying down the mortgage on these properties becomes much easier when you’re using a tenant’s money to do so, as opposed to your own.&nbsp;

**Tax benefits related to mortgage interest deductions and depreciation are also a major advantage that real estate investors.** Beyond that, properties appreciate over time, making real estate a very powerful way to build wealth.&nbsp;

At this point, you may be thinking to yourself, “Well, that sounds great. But what about taking care of the property? I don’t want to get a phone call in the middle of the night from a tenant asking me to fix their leaky faucet.”&nbsp;

This concern is completely understandable, but also easy to resolve. Many rental investors feel this way, which is why they hire a property management company to take care of these tasks for them. **Property management companies can handle all of the logistics of running a rental property for a very affordable price, depending on who you work with. &nbsp;**

As for the kind of property you should invest in, there is no one correct answer. It simply depends on your goals. So if you are thinking of investing in real estate, please reach out to me. I would be happy to speak to you more about how investment properties work and connect you to an experienced, local mortgage professional.&nbsp;
