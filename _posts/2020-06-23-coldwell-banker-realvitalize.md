### RealVitalize Powered by HomeAdvisor

**Make strategic home improvements to maximize your sales price – and pay nothing until closing with RealVitalize and Casey Cooke.**

The REALVITALIZE program, powered by HomeAdvisor, is an exclusive offering for Coldwell Banker Realty clients that helps with home improvements and repairs to prep your home for sale. We cover the upfront costs and get paid back when the home sells. No hidden fees, interest charges or markups.

**Here’s how the RealVitalize Program works:**

When you go through the RealVitalize Program powered by Home Advisor, we’ll put together a listing agreement and discuss what strategic projects we can do &nbsp;to boost your home’s value and maximize your equity. Then, we’ll reach out to Home Advisor to refer you to the best vendors in the area for whatever job you need to be done.

Then you, the homeowner, will meet with contractors to interview them and compare prices as you would normally.&nbsp;**Once you’ve approved a contractor, they’ll come in to do the work, and here’s the best part: Coldwell Banker will pay the vendor up front\!**&nbsp;When your home sells, the cost to pay the contractor will be deducted from the proceeds.

There are no fees or interest payments to worry about, either. The RealVitalize Program is a tool that Coldwell Banker has come up with to help their agents maximize their business.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, I can’t imagine why this wouldn’t sound like a wonderful program for you to consider. For any questions you have about the RealVitalize Program powered by Home Advisor, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We can discuss the entire program in more detail and figure out how it can benefit you given your unique situation.
