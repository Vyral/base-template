What do people really mean when they ask about corporate culture?&nbsp;

It’s nice to be able to take your dog to work or have an office softball team. Those kinds of things are important in cultivating a company’s culture. Really, though, **there are only three core things people think about anytime they consider a job change:**

* **Transparency**
* **Will this new company have my back?**
* **Will they allow me to grow?**

What is transparency? Transparency simply means that you’re open, direct, and your employees know what to do to meet or exceed expectations internally and that you’ll tell them when they are not. If there are changes, transparency means you will speak to them directly and openly.&nbsp;

How can you have their back? Everybody makes mistakes; it’s part of being human. Employees need to know how you’re going to respond to that. Any employee that is allowed more autonomy and allowed to take more risks is going to be more creative and likely achieve a higher rate of production. If they make a mistake, will you use that as a coaching opportunity and help them work through their error so they can use it as a learning experience? This is critical, because employees will chafe in their role if you don’t let them make mistakes.&nbsp;

How can you allow them to grow? By supporting learning by experience. Everybody wants to progress in their jobs and see variety in their day-to-day tasks. If you don’t allow those things, that employee will grow stale and be looking over their shoulder wondering whether or not this is the right opportunity for them. You need to be able to show them that you can give them the challenges and opportunities they need to grow and be willing to help them do that.&nbsp;

**As a hiring manager, you need to be able to know whether you have existing examples that will allow your future employees to be able to see that you can give them these three things.** Can you speak to these examples clearly so that they’re willing to leave the job that they have and join your company? If you can, you’re going to do a much better job overall of attracting top talent.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how to attract and facilitate talent, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to speaking with you!&nbsp;
