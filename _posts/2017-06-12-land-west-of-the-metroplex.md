Have you thought of buying land west of the MetroPlex?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I moved to this area 20 years ago after I bought my first home in Stephenville when I was 19. Before I bought that home, though, I looked for land anywhere from Springtown south to Meridian and 70 miles west of Fort Worth.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**The price of property just seemed way too high back then.** Now, I can’t help thinking, “If I could only go back 20 years.” &nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Lately, we’ve shown several clients land properties that they want to live on or use as a recreational weekend getaway. Land close to Fort Worth is getting harder to find, and the searches are moving further and further away. With a new Tollway and I-20, though, those properties are easier to access.&nbsp;

<br>**If you’ve ever thought about buying land, now is the time to do so.** After all, you don’t want to be left saying, “If I could only go back 20 years.”&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have. I would be happy to help you!
