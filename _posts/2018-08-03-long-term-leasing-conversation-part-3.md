Welcome back to the third and final part of our conversation with Kim Drury of Angel Properties about long-term leasing. Here are the final few questions from our conversation about Angel Properties, long-term leasing, and their best strategies.

***What are the benefits of long-term leasing from a property tax perspective?***

That’s a great question. Park City is part of Summit County, where primary ownership of a property is recognized through a discounted rate. If someone has a long-term tenant in their property who is using the property as a primary residence, it qualifies for the primary residence tax rate as well. This is about a 45% savings on taxes. There is no limit on the number of properties an owner can own to claim that tax benefit.

***Why would an owner consider long-term leasing in a community where short-term rentals are so popular?***

As a property investor, you want to maximize your investment in a property. There are a few different ways to do that. One is by caring for the property. We have found that, generally, having a long-term renter equates to better maintenance of the property. Secondly, long-term leasing minimizes vacancy costs. Finally, some of the costs that go into nightly property management, including turnover costs and extra taxes, are not incurred with a long-term lease. A lot of property owners end up making more money on their investment by utilizing a long term lease.

***What achievement are you most proud of in regards to Angel Properties and their contribution to the community?***

We really keep a high standard of leasing within Park City. The processes we have instituted protect both the homeowner and the renter. When prospective tenants are renting high-end homes, we help mitigate that transaction so that funds are processed in a safe and responsible manner. This is something we really pride ourselves on.
