Is the market for $2 million homes really a slower market?

The other day, someone told me they were seeing all these “For Sale” signs for homes in a higher price range and none of them were selling.

When you see these signs, don’t forget to differentiate between the ones that stay unchanged and the ones that eventually get a “SOLD” banner put over them. As you’ll see, **anything that’s priced right—even in a $2 million market—will go under contract within 14 days.&nbsp;**

In fact, I listed a home for $2.3 million not too long ago and had a ratified contract for it within three days. Soon after that, I listed a home for just under $3 million, and that home took just eight days to go under contract.&nbsp;

It doesn’t matter what market we’re in, what time of year it is, or which price range we focus on—if the price doesn’t match the product, buyers won’t make an offer.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
