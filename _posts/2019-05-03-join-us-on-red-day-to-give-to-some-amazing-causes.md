<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Every year between May 9 to May 16, the Dar Walden Team celebrates Red Day. What is Red Day? Find out right here.</em></p>

Red Day is a special day held every year between May 9 and May 16, during which all of our 400 agents donate their time back to the communities in Anchorage, Wasilla, and Eagle River.

During Red Day, we typically pick one or two projects that involve someone in need of help. We’ve helped repaint a women’s shelter, we’ve assisted with the Fairview Food Bank, and many other such projects.

It’s a great day and a lot of fun, and at the same time, we’re giving back to the community. This year for Red Day,&nbsp;**we’ll be hosting a blood drive on May 9 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.**

Our goal is to break the record for the most blood donated on any single event. We’ll need to get 3,000 units of blood donated, and we need your help to do that.&nbsp;

The blood van will be parked in the Keller Williams parking lot at 101 West Benson Boulevard in Anchorage, so if you’re out and about on May 9, be sure to look for us there\!

The 3,000 units of blood we hope to collect is enough to supply the Children’s Hospital for an entire year\!

**If you can’t make it to Red Day this May, you’re welcome to go to any blood bank and donate on behalf of the Dar Walden Team.**

In addition to the blood drive, we’ll also be hosting a food drive for the benefit of the Children’s Kitchen in Fairview. As you may or may not already know, the founder of the Children’s Kitchen recently passed away, and we’re working really hard to keep this program going.&nbsp;

The Kitchen is in need of items like whole wheat pasta, fruit leather, canned foods, rice, macaroni and cheese, tuna, and other individually wrapped goods that can be passed out to those young kids who might otherwise not have a meal to eat. **You can stop by our office any time to drop off your donations.** Of course, cash donations are also welcome\!

We strongly encourage you to step up and help us donate to these invaluable causes on Red Day. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Hope to see you here on Red Day this year\!
