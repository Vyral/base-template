Last month, Metro Vancouver home sales reached typical historical levels with the majority of those sales concentrated in the townhouse and condominium markets.

**Realtors registered approximately 3,000 sales on the region’s multiple listing service (or MLS) last month**, making it a double-digit increase over last year. It was also above the 10-year sales average for October.

Supply, however, continues to vary depending on the type of property. For the detached home market, there is currently a supply of 5,587 properties. This is relieving pressure on prices.

But the opposite is true in townhome and condo markets. Buyers continue to have a limited supply of properties to choose from, **which is contributing to some upward pressure on pricing**.

To understand the difference between supply and demand, we can look to the sales-to-active listings ratio. When the ratio dips below the 12% mark for a sustained period, there can be downward pressure on pricing.

But when the ratio surpasses 20% over several months, upward pressure can be expected. Today, the ratio across all housing types in the Metro Vancouver area shows that we are still in a seller’s market.

If we break it down by property type, we can see that detached homes are in a clear buyer’s market, while townhomes and condos fall within a seller’s market.

Home prices reflect this varied demand. In the last year, demand for detached homes has increased 4%. **But townhomes and condos have both seen double-digit gains since last year, with an increase of 18% and 22%, respectively.**

If you’re looking to enter the market as either a buyer or a seller, it’s important to work with your local realtor so you understand the latest market trends and set realistic expectations to help you achieve your housing goals.<br><br>If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.
