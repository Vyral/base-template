As you know, one of the most important lead sources we agents have is sign calls. The past few years, my team and I have been running a program that’s helped us triple our sign calls, and today I’ll tell you how to implement this program.&nbsp;

The program is called Open House Every Day. When we put a sign in front of one of our listings, the rider says ‘Open House Every Day’ and ‘Call for Times.’ At the bottom of the rider, we include a tracking number where buyers can reach our agents. You can see an example of one of our riders at 0:53 in the video above. We’ve generated somewhere around 700 calls from buyers using these riders.&nbsp;

Here are the three main benefits you get from using this program:

**1\. You get calls from reluctant buyers.** You’re giving them one more option to call and schedule a viewing without any obligation. Once they call, their phone number is recorded so you can follow up with them whenever you want. If they call asking about an open house, you can tell them when that is (if there’s one scheduled). If there is no open house scheduled, you can set up a private one just for them, which leads me to our next benefit...

**2\. You can avoid traditional open houses.** That is to say, you don’t have to spend six hours at a time at the house every Saturday looking for buyers. This program allows you to host open houses 24/7 and still get a lot of buyers leads.&nbsp;

**3\. You can show off your creativity to sellers.** With this creative marketing tool, you can generate lots of exposure for their property. At the same time, because you can host private open houses any time you want, they don’t have to worry about lots of strangers walking through their property.&nbsp;

This program is something you absolutely must have in your business. If you have questions about implementing it or would like to know more about how it benefits you, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.
