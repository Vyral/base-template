Imagine you’re getting ready to go on a great vacation and as your plane gets ready for takeoff at SFO, the flight attendant says, “Ladies and gentlemen, the captain would like me to inform you that there is an 85% chance that we will not get you to your destination on time and safely.” Are you going to stay on that flight? No way! Not with an 85% chance of failure!

Throughout my years of working with people like you and your employees, I’ve come to find that **85% of your employees have an 85% chance of not making it to retirement on time and safely.**&nbsp;

That’s one of the reasons I’m starting this series. I want to share with you all the different ideas and resources I’ve accumulated over the years from people who spend a lot of time thinking about how to help you and your employees reach your retirement goals safely and on time.&nbsp;

**Today I want to share a simple idea with you that comes from Dr. Gregory Kasten.** He was an anesthesiologist before getting into the pension plan world, and he brings that level of discipline into thinking about pension plans and how we retire. He has since written a 700-page book on good retirement practices. I want to share a basic summary from that book that will help you get to that adequate retirement income on-time and safely.

**Everything comes down to having adequate savings, using quality assets with the money that you save, and making sure that your money is spread around to those different assets with a good allocation model.** It all may sound fairly easy, but the challenge is with the implementation. I won’t go into detail about that today, but I will in the future.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
