Today I’m joined by Emma Johnson, the director of the local Safe Families chapter here in Madison County, to help spread the word about her wonderful organization and how they help our community.

**Safe Families is a faith-based nonprofit organization that allows parents in crisis to reach out and ask for help.** They do this by working with local churches to recruit host families who then volunteer their time. The backgrounds of these families are thoroughly checked and they’re then trained to take in a child in need.

A parent in crisis can call Safe Families’ hotline and explain why they need to place their child. They provide a temporary placement for the child to allow the parent the time and resources to get back on their feet. Their overall goal is to keep kids out of the system that don’t need to be there.

To this organization, there’s more than one way to define a parent in crisis. They could be facing homelessness, experiencing a domestic violence situation, or undergoing some kind of hospitalization and have nowhere to place their children in the meantime.

Safe Families considers themselves a church movement, but they don’t just work through churches to recruit host families. They also want their host families to build mentoring relationships with the parents in crisis so that network of support can give them what they need to better the lives of themselves and their children. In their experience, people in need want to make changes; they just don’t know how and they don’t have the support system to teach them how. For them, it’s well worth the time and effort to provide that support. &nbsp;

For Emma, being the director is a full-time job, so **if you would like to make a donation to Safe Families, you can visit their website at [anderson.safe-families.org](http://anderson.safe-families.org).&nbsp;**They also hold fundraisers throughout the year, including a concert coming up in August for which they’re looking for business sponsors for support. We’re happy to say we plan on being one of those sponsors

We’re also happy to say that during the month of April, our team will kick back a percentage of all of our closed transactions to Safe Families. April tends to be one of our biggest months in terms of sales, so there’s no time like the present for us to lend a hand.

If you’d like to know more about Safe Families, feel free to browse the above-listed website. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help.
