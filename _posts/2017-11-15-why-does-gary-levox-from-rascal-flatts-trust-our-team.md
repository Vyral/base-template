**Recently we were fortunate enough to land an endorsement from one of our favorite musicians: Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts.**

You can hear everything Gary had to say in the full endorsement above, but one thing that stood out to us was the connection he made between his music and what we do.

*“Ever since “I’m Moving On” hit the radio, it’s been very cool hearing from our fans personally how this song helped them get through the hard times. Moving across the street or across the country can be very stressful too. But it doesn’t have to be. You’ve got a great agent right in your backyard who can make it easy and virtually stress-free.”*- Gary LeVox
