Whether you’re a real estate investor or you’re looking to relocate to Scottsdale but can’t quite make it down here full-time yet, the model leaseback homes of the White Horse luxury community are a great option for you. There are three immediate reasons why:&nbsp;

**1\. Location.** This community lies within close proximity to all the city’s best food and entertainment options—not to mention the Scottsdale Airpark area.<br>**2\. Features.** There are a plethora of great features the White Horse homes offer, whether you buy a spec home or a model home the builder is willing to lease back.<br>**3\. Decorations.** As you can see in the video above, the decorations for these homes are outstanding. The house I’m in is a farmhouse-style home, and you can move into it as is.

There are financial benefits of these leaseback homes, too. First of all, the builder is your tenant, so not only will the home be immaculate, but the lease rate is 5% of the purchase price. **Depending on your financial situation and how you buy the property, you’ll have all your debt servicing covered (and then some).** You’ll have cash flow from the builder while they’re taking phenomenal care of your property until it’s ready to be moved into.&nbsp;

They’re also a great long-term investment. There are two model leaseback homes in White Horse. One offers a four-to-six month leaseback, while the other (the one I’m standing in) offers a 12-month leaseback—and possibly even longer.&nbsp;

So, if you’re thinking of buying a second home or relocating to Scottsdale, this could be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. If you’d like to see more of White Horse or want to know more about leaseback homes, give me a call and I’d be happy to speak to you.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.
