Today we’re pleased to be speaking with Abbi Gilson, a great agent on the SOLDwisch Team. We’ll discuss how she got into real estate, her experience so far, and what drew her to the team.&nbsp;

Abbi is from Prairie City, Iowa, so she is very familiar with the Central Iowa area. She played softball in her youth, and she was even on Missouri State’s collegiate team while she attended school there. As soon as she graduated, she jumped into real estate, and she’s been a valuable member of our group for two and a half years.&nbsp;

According to Abbi, the reason why most people get into real estate is that they’re crazy, so she supposes she’s in the same boat. As a communications major in college, she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do after graduation. When she thought real estate might be her path, she knew she didn’t want to start off in the business alone. **Misty’s team approach seemed inviting, so Abbi attended one of her meet and greets, and the rest is history.&nbsp;**

Since she joined the SOLDwisch team, Abbi’s experience has been very different from a solo agent. Instead of juggling different roles at the same time, she has the pleasure of talking to new clients when they call the team about new listings or selling a home. She’s at the frontline of our business, which frees up time for our other agents to be out in the field working.&nbsp;

When Abbi talks to buyers, especially first-time buyers, she tries to set up a meeting in our office. **The process can be overwhelming for buyers, so this gives us a great opportunity to explain what they can expect when looking at properties.** Some people may be vaguely aware they need a mortgage, but many buyers don’t know exactly what they need or what they can afford.

We encourage all our buyer clients to find an agent they can work with one on one. This way, if they have any questions, they have a resource on our team willing to walk them through whatever they need. Everyone on the team relies on one another to provide the best experience for our clients, just like how Abbi worked together with her softball team to compete.&nbsp;

We’d like to thank Abbi once again for taking the time to speak with us; it was great to catch up with her\! If you have questions about a career in real estate or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to help\!
