*Here’s why we’re immensely grateful for your support this past year. *

As we look back on 2020 and gaze ahead into 2021 with excitement, we recognize the unique challenges that this past year brought all of us. For some, 2020 was a great year, or perhaps a mediocre one; for others, it just felt like one wave after another kept crashing down on them. Through it all, though, **we were able to help 106 families make the right moves into their new homes.** Making a move in the market isn’t something to be taken lightly—especially amid a pandemic—but they trusted us with one of the largest investments of their lives.&nbsp;

Our commitment is not only to provide a service, but an experience. **Amazingly, 85% of those 106 families were referred to us by past clients or other referral partners;** that’s something we’re incredibly grateful for as we reflect on 2020. Additionally, we were able to bring on two new agents, Carlos and Kino, to help them build their careers and create a lifestyle that truly satisfies them. We’ve also added Melissa, who has been absolutely instrumental in helping us market our listings to a wider audience.&nbsp;

Here’s what I’m most proud of, though: **We donated 3% of our profits back to community causes** (as we do every year) and were able to spotlight six awesome local restaurants in an effort to help drive new business their way. Beyond that, we had the privilege of partnering with phenomenal charities like Team Kids, an organization that empowers kids to change the world and learn important leadership skills. Thanks to your support, we were also able to donate to Working Wardrobes, Priceless Pets Rescue, I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue, and Girls Inc.&nbsp;

**None of this would’ve been possible without your support.** Our goal is to enrich the community we serve through our real estate business. On behalf of our entire team, I want to express a deep sense of gratitude for everything you’ve done to help us grow this past year. Together, we can make a larger impact on our community and change lives for the better.&nbsp;

I hope your 2021 starts off on a fantastic note. As always, we’re here to help with any real estate needs or questions you may have; just give us a call or send an email. Thank you again, and we look forward to hearing from you\!
