<center><em>Spring is here, and it&rsquo;s bringing out the buyers and sellers in our marketplace.</em></center>

Just last week, we listed four homes and put five under contract. This just goes to show that **now is a great time to buy or sell**. Over the next 90 days, we'll likely see many more listings and buyers come to our market.

As of right now, inventory is still low across the board. Depending on the price range, it’s down anywhere from 13% to 23% compared to where it was at this time last year.

Don’t wait to take advantage of this opportunity.

As always, if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
