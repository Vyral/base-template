What effect will a Trump presidency have on our local real estate market?<br>While Trump hasn’t taken the oath yet, we still saw some big changes almost immediately after the election was declared over. The first change was that **the stock market reached an all-time high in late November,** with a benchmark of over 19,000 points.

The next change we saw within the first week of the election was **interest rates going up by almost a quarter of a point.** Lastly, **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have increased their loan limits in Orange County, Ventura County, and Los Angeles County from roughly $625,000 to $636,000.**This is a great benefit if you’re a buyer, because these two typically have the lowest interest rates.

All three of these changes are signs that we still have a strong economy. Many economists and other financial specialists are predicting that we won’t be experiencing any kind of downturn any time soon.
