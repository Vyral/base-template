On our most recent installment of “Facebook Live Friday,” we discussed three types of storm damage homeowners should be aware of: hail damage, wind damage, and water damage.

If you didn’t catch this great interview when it was live, don’t worry. We’ll be sharing the highlights from the Q&A session here for you today.

**What should homeowners look out for when it comes to hail damage?**

Divots in a home’s shingles or siding are the two most common forms of hail damage homeowners should check for after a storm. While you’re checking on these things, also make sure to give your car and your A/C unit a look as well.

**What should homeowners look out for when it comes to wind damage?**

If your property was recently subject to strong winds, you’ll definitely want to check your roof and shutters. You should also make sure that any landscaping features on your property, like trees or large shrubs, haven’t left debris around your yard. If you do notice such debris, be certain to check your windows for any cracks in case this debris came into contact with them.

**What should homeowners look out for when it comes to water damage?**

Water damage tends to be the most common and most significant type of weather-related damage in our area. Homeowners who suspect their home has sustained water damage should check their ceilings for stains, check their basements for a damp smell or for mold, and should also check around their foundation for any of these issues as well. Homeowners should realize, too, that water damage might not manifest itself right away.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
