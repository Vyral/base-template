We’re so delighted to announce that we recently shot a new commercial with our sponsor Barbara Corcoran! We're going to give you a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of this commercial today, but first, we’d like to take a moment to share some of the latest statistics from our Louisville Real Estate Market.

The recent developments in our market should make both buyers and sellers in Southern Indiana and Louisville feel optimistic: **Inventory levels are coming out of the doldrums they were in for several years and are now showing a year-over-year increase.  **

Mortgage rates have dipped to an average of 4.55% in recent weeks, but don’t expect this to last: **Rates are projected to rise by Q3 and Q4 of this year**. Even so, they’re well below the historical numbers—they reached a whopping a 12.7% in the 1980s.

A slight uptick in days on market for our area means buyers should get out and start looking at homes now.

The prevailing sentiment among experts is that home prices will continue to appreciate in 2019 and won’t lose steam in 2020, either. In fact, **appreciation is projected to escalate so high that economists believe if you buy a home worth $250,000 in 2019, that home will be worth as much as $289,520 by 2024—that’s $39,520 in growth!**

In short, we expect 2019 to be a banner year for buying and selling in our real estate market.        

Now that we've reviewed the latest happenings in our market, we'd like to show what went into filming our commercial, and finally, unveil the finished product. When it was all said and done, filming with Barbara was about a four-hour affair. **It took a few hours of hard work, but the end result was incredible.**
