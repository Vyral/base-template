We are in the very early stages of the stay-at-home order issued by Governor Walz, and naturally, we’re getting so many calls, texts, and emails from folks asking us if the real estate market has shut down. The answer is no, we’re up and running; real estate is considered an essential service. **We’re helping buyers and sellers with every step of the process, and mortgage and title companies are fully operational.** As you can imagine, however, it’s not quite business as usual—many parts of the lending, home selling, and buying processes have been altered to accommodate sanitation and the recommended separation of parties.

If you have further questions for us, or if we can offer our assistance in any way, please reach out by phone or email. We’re here for you. It doesn’t have to necessarily be real estate related—if we can help in these times, we will.&nbsp;
