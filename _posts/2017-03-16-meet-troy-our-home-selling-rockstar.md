Today I'm happy to introduce you to Troy, our team's lead listing agent. Troy handles all of our listings and was a huge part of our success in 2016.

We had a great year last year and were able to list and sell 58 homes. We sold them for 98.8% of the original list price in 35 days on average. To boot, **we sold 40% of our listings last year at or above list price.** Compare that to the Baltimore metro average of homes selling at 95% of their list price. Just by deciding to work with us, our clients made 3.8% more for their homes on average.

We have specialists in every area of a real estate transaction, as Troy points out, which is a big benefit for our clients. Troy has a marketing background and works with stagers, photographers, and with our team's database of buyers. He helps our clients make sure their homes look spectacular the first day they go on the market and gets potential buyers through the door right away.

With the spring market coming up and inventory as low as it is, Troy is happy to say that we have 34 homes coming on the market in the next 12 weeks with 10 currently on the market. Homes are selling very quickly in our market right now, making it vitally important to work with a great agent like Troy.

On a final note, Troy and I both want to thank everyone who came out to our client appreciation event recently. I also want to thank Troy for joining me today.

If you have any questions for us or you're thinking of buying or selling a home in the Baltimore metro, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to help!
