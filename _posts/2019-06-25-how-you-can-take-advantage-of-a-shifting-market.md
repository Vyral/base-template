Are you prepared to take advantage of a shifting market?

A market shift happens anytime the market changes from one predominant system to another. Currently, we’re in a seller’s market, which means listings are king. As you may notice, though, we’re shifting away from this. **Most economists and real estate analysts predict that toward the end of this year and into 2020, we’ll enter into a more balanced market.** This means you’ll have to work harder and take advantage of other marketing techniques you might not be using.&nbsp;

Most economists also agree that by 2020, we’ll be entering a bit of a recession. Here at KW, we understand very well how to work through a shifting market. Our CEO Gary Keller even wrote a book about it called “Shift,” which lists 12 tactis you can take advantage of to conquer a shifting market.&nbsp;
