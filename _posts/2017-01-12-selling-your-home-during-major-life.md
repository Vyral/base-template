A major life change can definitely impact your real estate transaction. When people face trying times, they tend to make mistakes during their real estate transaction. We’re only human after all. Today, I’ll go over a few common mistakes for you to avoid.

 First of all, if you suddenly lose your job but can afford to keep your home, don’t put it on the market right away. See if you can get a new job in the same area before you sell. If you can’t make your mortgage payments without your job, call us right away.

**Another stressful life event that can impact your transaction is a divorce.** You need to deal with what makes sense. Should you offer a buyout? Should you agree to sell the home? Which option is the best one for you?

When people get divorced, they are dealing with a loss of the future. They are thinking about all of the dreams that they planned as a couple and watching them disappear. People try to hold onto that future and make emotional decisions, such as paying too much to retain the home. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell the home and get a new start.

**The third major life event that can be challenging is when you lose a loved one.** The biggest mistake I see is that people either sell too quickly or hold on too long. I believe that there is a natural period where you need to have your time to grieve. Don’t do anything now.

 My team and I are here to help you so that you can make the right decisions for your situation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We are here to help you come up with the right plan, so if you find yourself in a stressful situation, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!
