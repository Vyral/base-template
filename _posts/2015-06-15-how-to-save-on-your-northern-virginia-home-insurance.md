{% include youtube.html %}Today, we share some tips to help you save money on your home insurance! Megan Merkosky of Brown & Brown Insurance is here to explain.

**Deductibles play a part in your home insurance and can help drive down your premium.** We recommend a deductible of $1,000 or more, because the higher the deductible, the lower your insurance prices will be. In other words, the lower your deductible, the higher your monthly payment will be for insurance.

A deductible higher than $1,000 will keep you from filing claims that aren't necessary. **Fires, thefts, a flooding basement: these are things that you should file claims for, not things a handyman could fix.** To maximize your insurance discount and save you more money, it's beneficial to have all your insurance policies (home, auto, etc.) in one place.

By reaching out to someone at Brown & Brown Insurance, you will maximize your time, get a second pair of eyes, and an advisor to help you. **A home is one of the biggest purchases you'll make, so you want to make sure it's insured correctly!** Give us a call or shoot us an email if you have any questions, or you can reach Megan directly at [571-229-1443](tel:571-229-1443) or [MMerkosky@BBDCMetro.com](mailto:MMerkosky@BBDCMetro.com).
