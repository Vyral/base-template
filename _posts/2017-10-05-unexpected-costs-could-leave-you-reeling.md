Today we’re going to discuss some of the unexpected costs you may run into when purchasing a home, specifically regarding closing costs.

**Closing costs are different from the cost to close.** A lot of people think closing costs are everything they’ll need to close on a home.

In our area, however, closing costs are strictly defined in the contract, so the difference between specific closing costs and the total cost to close could be thousands of dollars.

Your annual homeowners insurance is not a closing cost—it is a cost to close, as are property taxes. Things like that can run up your cost to close very quickly, so **when you’re getting a quote for closing costs, make sure it’s not just for closing costs, but how much money you will actually need in total to be able to close on the home.**
