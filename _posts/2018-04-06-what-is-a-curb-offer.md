Today we’re going to talk about curb offers for commercial properties and some of the key information you’ll need to know about them.

**In commercial real estate, curb offers are pretty common.**What is a curb offer? Well, it’s an offer that you’re making on a property without going through or even seeing the property. If it’s a listed property and there are dozens of buyers interested, instead of having a ton of walkthroughs that disturb tenants, a lot of sellers will provide what’s called “a curb offer.”

The owners typically try to take really good pictures of the property, provide really good information about the property, and other data that allows you to make an assumption on what the value of the property is.** By using comparable sales, you can get a really good idea of what a property will go for.**

The curb offers we generally submit contain a few different contingencies. First, it’s contingent on a walkthrough of the building. We also put a contingency in there for us to negotiate the purchase price based on the property’s condition.

The biggest question to ask yourself before pulling the trigger is, “Does it make sense for me?” If I think there is going to be significant capital improvement needed after touring only a few units, I’d probably stay away from that one. **A lot of this will come down to the interest in the property itself.**

Hopefully this has been helpful for you. We submit curb offers all the time and they’ve worked out well for us because we do our homework. If you have any questions for me about curb offers or anything else about commercial real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
