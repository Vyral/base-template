Recently, we sat down with one of our agents, Jenny, to get her thoughts on her experience as an agent so far, her time with the team, and more:

“My career in real estate began a couple of years ago. I just kind of had this restlessness in my heart for a change, and around that time in 2018, I had a friend ask me what I truly wanted to do with my life. No one had asked me that before, and it was the first time I had said out loud what I had been thinking for quite some time, **which was that I'd like to try a career in real estate.&nbsp;**

“She told me that if I ever decide to take that seriously, I should contact Dave Hook. Up until that point, I had been working for years in various forms of teaching and ministry, but as my kids were getting a little bit older, I started to think about the next phase of my life and what that would look like.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

“Real estate started to stand out to me, so I took my friend's advice and called Dave for a meeting. Up until that point, I didn't realize that working in real estate on a team was even an option. I thrive working on teams, so that whole idea really spoke to me. The second reason I got excited was how Dave was talking about enriching the lives of those he worked with, and I got excited about doing the same thing.&nbsp;

“You know, I didn't know if I would be successful at real estate or not, but it was a huge risk. But then, once I was able to prove that I could do it, the challenge was this mindset of how do I continue this success? **As each new challenge came my way, I was able to lean on the team to guide me through them.** They proved that with a showing agent and a transaction coordinator, you're able to have a very full career and also a very balanced life. I can still be a mom to three kids, which I think really says something. At this point, I don’t think I would change anything.”
