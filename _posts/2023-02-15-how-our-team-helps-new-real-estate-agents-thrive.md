We recently sat down with one of our agents, Jenny Robeson, to get her thoughts on her experience as an agent so far, her time with the team, and more.

“My career in real estate began a couple of years ago. I just kind of had this restlessness in my heart for a change, and around that time in 2018, I had a friend ask me what I truly wanted to do with my life. No one had asked me that before, and it was the first time I said out loud what I had been thinking for quite some time, which was that **I'd like to try a career in real estate.&nbsp;**

“She told me that if I ever decide to take that seriously, I should contact Dave Hook. Up until that point, I had been working for years in various forms of teaching and ministry, but as my kids were getting a little bit older, I started to think about the next phase of my life and what that would look like.

“Real estate started to stand out to me, so I took my friend's advice and called Dave for a meeting. Up until that point, I didn't realize that working in real estate on a team was even an option. I thrive working on teams, so that whole idea really spoke to me. Also, Dave was talking about enriching the lives of those he worked with, and I got excited about doing the same thing.&nbsp;

“I didn't know if I would be successful at real estate or not, and it was a huge risk. But then, once I was able to prove that I could do it, the challenge was this mindset of how do I continue this success? **As each new challenge came my way, I was able to lean on the team to guide me through.** They proved that with a showing agent and a transaction coordinator, you're able to have a very full career and balanced life. I can still be a mom to three kids, which I think really says something. At this point, I don’t think I would change anything.”
