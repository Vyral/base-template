We have not had a new, updated version of Utah’s real estate purchase contract for about five or six years, but that has finally changed. The new contract will go into effect in September, when Utah Realtors hold their convention in Park City.&nbsp;

So, I want to let you know about some of the great enhancements that will make our business lives much easier.&nbsp;

One of the first improvements is that the tax ID number will be delineated separately from the address section. Plus, “included items” now include solar panels, water softeners, TV wall mounts, and any speakers associated with that system.&nbsp;

**The agreement better addresses issues of personal property.** Prorations deal very nicely with rental deposits, which is especially important for long-term rental properties. That can be a little trickier with short-term rentals such as Airbnb or HomeAway. These platforms don’t have contracts but allow renters to prepay, so how do you deal with those?

The new REPC also cleaned things up on the leasing side and added a FIRPTA clause into the seller disclosure. FIRPTA deals with foreign buyers and their obligation to pay taxes in their home country.&nbsp;

Another important change is that the license number has to be included in the agency disclosure section.&nbsp;

**The new REPC even nicely addresses changes that happen during the escrow period,** such as significant construction or the buyer incurring additional debt. The language has been cleaned up to make things more clear to both parties.&nbsp;

Again, these changes are coming this September, so be prepared. Overall, though, I think these changes are good, and I hope you’ll agree.&nbsp;

If you have any questions in the meantime, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
