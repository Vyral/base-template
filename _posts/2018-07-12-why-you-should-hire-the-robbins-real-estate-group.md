<center>While there a hundred reasons why you should hire the Robbins Real Estate Group, I have three great ones for you today.</center>

&nbsp;

Today I have three reasons why you should hire the Robbins Real Estate Group. While I could give you a hundred reasons, I would like to keep it short.

The first reason you should hire us also happens to be the most important: **You are looking for an agent or Realtor who is going to take care of you and put your interests first**. We promise that we will never put our needs above yours and will always make sure that you are doing what is right for you.

The next reason you should hire us is that we have a great track record. **We have closed well over a thousand transactions and 700 of those were in the last 10 years**. In fact, during that time, our sellers on average have gotten at least 100% of the list price. In a market where 25% to 30% of the listings oftentimes fail to sell, almost all of our listings close with a successful sale.

If you are a buyer, we will take great care of you and make sure that you get the right deal on the house for you. Even with multiple offers, we can get you the house you want.

Finally, **the third reason you should hire us is that we have great systems in place**. I have a team of people dedicated to making sure that your transaction goes smoothly. We have specialists who work with buyers, a transaction coordinator who makes sure that everything is taken care of in your transaction, a listing coordinator to make sure that the marketing goes properly and everything is online correctly, and a courier to make sure that your flyer boxes are always full if you are selling.

We have a great team who would love to work with you, so please feel free to contact us if you are interested in buying or selling. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
