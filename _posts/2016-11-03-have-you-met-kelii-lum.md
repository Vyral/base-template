*Keli’i Lum is a buyer specialist here at Team Lally. What he enjoys most about working with us is the atmosphere and support we provide.*

Today, we wanted you to get to know a little bit about Keli’i Lum.

**How did you hear about Team Lally?**
A while ago, I decided I wanted to be a real estate investor, so I went to a real estate seminar and thought to myself: “I want to get out there and hit the real estate market and start selling homes and buying homes. Everything under the sun dealing with real estate.” So I went to these seminars and they advised reaching out to a real estate company and spending six months or so learning from professionals within the industry.

**What motivated you to join Team Lally?**
They’re among the top teams and top companies in Hawaii, and that’s what led me to go out there and join them. If you want to be the best, you have to learn from the best. I want to serve my clients and customers the best way I possibly can.

**What’s your role on the team?**
I’m a buyer specialist. I’m here to help buyers get into homes, educate them about the process, and get them into a comfortable state so that by the time we get to the end, they’re a happy customer.

**What do you enjoy most about working on a team?**
I love the atmosphere here. There is a lot to learn from a team. With a team by your side, you have a lot of support. There is a pool of information and experience you have access to that as a single agent you wouldn’t have access to. What’s even better, it’s a lot of fun being on a team!

If you have any questions for Keli’i or need help buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
