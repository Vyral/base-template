Downsizing is becoming increasingly popular in our market. If you're thinking of downsizing, keep these three tips in mind.

Downsizing has become an increasingly popular trend in the world of real estate, and as baby boomers come of age more and more people will have it on their minds.

If you've thought about downsizing, these three tips will help you start the process:

**1. Start with a plan:** Write down what you want to keep, what you want to donate, and what needs to come with you. We can help you create those lists and then organize your possessions accordingly.

**2. Start looking for your next house now:** You need to know where you're going before you put your current house on the market so that you can get a good idea of your next move. A good Realtor will help you clarify what you want and what you need in your next home and show you homes that meet your criteria. This step can also give you a taste of what your new lifestyle could be in your next neighborhood.
