How can you beat out other buyers in a competitive market? Today, I’ve got some key tips that can help.

How can you beat out other buyers in a competitive market?

Today, I’d like to give you some information on how you can get the edge. What my team and I have found is that many buyers rely on websites like Zillow and Trulia to find their homes.

What I want to tell you now is to avoid making this mistake. **Looking on third-party websites is not a good strategy.** If you’ve ever found a property online, you may have had the unfortunate experience of calling your agent only to discover that the home has already gone under contract.

My team and I have a different approach. **We ask all of our buyers to come in so that we can really dig into what you’re looking for and set you up with a service that we pay for.** This service will give you instant access to home listings before most other buyers even become aware of them.  

One of the agents on our team recently helped a buyer get under contract before the property they were interested in even hit Zillow. We are able to do this because we have a team of agents who are always looking for properties.

Ultimately, this is the secret to beating out the competition. To win in a competitive market, you have to get to properties before anyone else. **You’ll also need to be backed by a team of agents who can help you in the process.**
