Today, we’re here with Bill Valway, CEO of Absolute Perfection, to talk about what he does there and what services his company provides.

Absolute Perfection is a multi-faceted business that **started in 2001 doing window tinting on cars.** He and his team quickly realized that there were other opportunities in the window film industry. They’ve since expanded to housing and office buildings, working heavily on energy conservation.

Additionally, **they began working with commercial graphics.** Bill found that this used a very similar skill set as far as the installation process goes. Now they do a lot of vehicle wrap advertising, having recently completed a large project for the Maryland Transit Administration where they wrapped over 400 buses.

Further still, Absolute Perfection has a digital marketing division which does website design and paid advertising on Google. **“Digital marketing is a very large part of the growth of a business,”** Bill says, “So we’ve been very blessed to have all those different components come together in one company.”<br><br>To get in touch with Absolute Perfection, visit www.APCorp.com.
