We’re in a very hot, competitive market, which means that inventory is turning very quickly. If you’re a seller in this market, there are a few techniques that we use to accelerate the process.

Why is it important to sell your home quickly? **The earlier the sale happens, the more money you’ll get.**

One of the techniques that we use is a pre-launch. Before your home goes live on the market, we launch your property to a select group of agents. These agents are all top producers, which means that they have most of the buyers currently looking in our market.

We will also launch your home on the MLS three or four days before we allow showings. That way, you’ll have three or four days of people looking at the home online before the first showing. For example, if we don’t allow showings until 10 a.m. on Saturday morning, by then, there will be six to 10 buyers wanting to look at your home.

This technique creates **fear of loss,** which motivates buyers to step up quickly with a strong offer.

There is a myriad of other ways to sell your home in a short amount of time. If you would like to learn more about those techniques or if you have any other questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
