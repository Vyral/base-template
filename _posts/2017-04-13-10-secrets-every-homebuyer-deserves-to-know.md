Most homes up for sale on the market are resale homes, but one out of every four homebuyers opts for a brand new home. New and resale homes each come with their own advantages.

So how do you know which is the right choice for you?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>On average, resale homes are less expensive and generally have the warmth and feeling of an established neighborhood. New homes, on the other hand, offer modern energy efficiency, innovative use of space, and everything is new—including the neighbors.

Determining which option is best for you depends on many things from your tastes to your family makeup and your finances.
