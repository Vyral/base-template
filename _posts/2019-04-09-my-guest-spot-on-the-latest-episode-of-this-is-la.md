How is Brad Korb Real Estate changing the real estate game?

That’s the question I got to answer on the latest episode of “This Is LA” on CBS, where I was able to sit down for an interview with host Adam Kruger. **Some of the other topics we discussed include:**

* How I got started in real estate
* Why we call ourselves a “community-focused real estate group”&nbsp;
* How much of the San Fernando Valley we service
* How our Guaranteed Sale Program helps struggling home sellers&nbsp;

You can refer to the video above to watch the segment in its entirety. It was my pleasure to be there!&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
