{% include youtube.html %} When it comes to closing costs, what is the seller responsible for and what is the buyer responsible for? To answer that, we’ll go through some standard costs associated with the close of a transaction.

There are always going to be escrow and title fees in any transaction. **The escrow fee is usually split 50/50 between the buyer and the seller,** and there are actually two title policies in most transactions. The first is the new buyer’s/ homeowner’s policy, which the seller pays for, and the other is the lender's policy, which the buyer usually pays for.

**T****he main closing costs on the buyer’s side are the lender’s fees, origination fees, the home inspection fee, and the appraisal.**

Sellers usually provide a one-year home warranty to the buyer and pay for a termite clearance. There’s also a county transfer tax and sometimes a homeowners association transfer fee that the seller pays for.

**Overall, the seller’s fees are usually about 1% of the purchase price.**The buyer’s fees are going to be a bit more expensive because of the lender’s fees.
