  I have a very special guest joining me this time. Dan Radebaugh is with R&P
  Settlement Group, one of the best title companies around. There is a lot you
  need to be aware of when purchasing a home from a title perspective, so you
  need to make sure you’re hiring the right person. Dan and I talked about how
  exactly to do that and much more. To see our full conversation, watch this
  short video.

Today I’m joined by a special guest for a special topic. Dan Radebaugh, with R&P Settlement Group, joined me recently for a wide-ranging discussion about titles, title companies, and what you should be looking for in one.

According to Dan, there are a number of things that a title company needs to be able to do. **When you’re choosing a company, start with an attorney-backed one like Dan’s.** They have the level of expertise that you need to make sure there are no hiccups in the process. It’s also important to hire a company that’s familiar with the local market. Things change so much from county to county that you need to have an expert on your side to keep up.

The biggest thing to watch out for during the title process is reviewing the title. If a mistake is made here, it won’t kill your transaction, but it will slow things down and make the issue bigger than it needs to be.

As far as** title insurance** is concerned, there are numerous benefits. It covers you in the event that a claim is made against your title and **ensures you don’t have anything to worry about when it comes to the ownership of your house.**

We also have to talk about service. Effective communication and quality service are key when hiring a title company. It’s important that they communicate well not only with you, but with your agent as well. That’s what sets Dan and his team apart, in my opinion.

Finally, a word of caution about hiring the cheapest guy in town. I will just say that **there are reasons why certain companies charge less,** and those reasons usually leave you susceptible to mistakes and future problems.

Thanks again to Dan for joining me and providing his expertise. If you have any additional questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We would love to hear from you.
