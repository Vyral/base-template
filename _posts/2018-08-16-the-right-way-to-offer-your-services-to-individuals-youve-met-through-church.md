You’ve probably heard that you should promote your business to friends and family. There’s an old adage in this business that says every real estate agent’s career should be based on sphere-of-influence marketing.

Yet what if most of your interpersonal connections come from church? Should you promote your real estate business in such a space?

Just this week, two agents approached me to ask this very question. And I’ve got a very short answer to it: Absolutely not. It is not appropriate to promote your business in church. That isn’t the reason you’re there.

**However, the relationships you build and the friends you make at church can help you build your database.** The contact information you gain from these people should be recorded into your database because, like you would to anyone else in your life, you should give your advice and assistance to these people when they need it.

It is fine to offer your services to those you meet at church, but never while you’re at church. If you struggle with this at any level, keep two questions in mind: Do the people you’ve met at church have real estate needs? And, do you, as a real estate professional, have the ability to serve those needs?

**If the answer to both of these questions is “yes,” it is my opinion that you have a moral obligation to help these individuals meet their goals.**

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
