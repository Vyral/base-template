Today, I’m joined by a special guest, Kim Lindquist from Edina Realty Home Warranties. Kim has been in real estate for over 25 years. She started on the warranty side about four years ago. We’re going to discuss what a warranty is and a few of the benefits of home warranties.

**What is a home warranty?**

A home warranty is a one-year service agreement that covers repairs and replacement of items due to normal wear and tear. One benefit for a buyer would be budget protection after you’ve purchased a home and maybe spent a lot of your savings to do so.

**How does a home warranty benefit a seller?**

There are three main benefits for sellers. The first is that the home warranty is not due until it closes, so it’s free during the listing period. The second is that the warranty offers peace of mind for the seller (and for the buyer when they move in). Finally, home warranties help prevent wholesale disputes.

**What happens if there is a claim? What does the process look like?**

Let’s say you have a leaky pipe underneath your kitchen or bathroom sink. You would simply go to [www.onlineHSA.com](http://www.onlinehsa.com/) and click “Register Claim.” You can also call us at 1-800-367-1408. Say, “Service,” and then “Customer service” to speak with a live rep that will help you file your claim. It is very simple and very easy. We are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

**Are there different coverage options for buyers and sellers?**

Absolutely. For sellers, we have an option for single-family properties at $485 with a $75 deductible or $465 with a $100 deductible. The seller can also add heating and air coverage for an extra $60.

When a buyer closes on the home and moves in, there are other options we can add as well. We offer a 7-star buyer upgrade and many other options to add on. If you have an extra freezer or refrigerator, you can add that coverage. You have 30 to 60 days after you close to add coverage.

If you have any other questions about home warranties, you can contact Kim Lindquist at 952-210-9809 or [KimLindquist@EdinaRealty.com.](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(75,105,109,76,105,110,100,113,117,105,115,116,64,69,100,105,110,97,82,101,97,108,116,121,46,99,111,109))) As always, you can contact Sara and me with any real estate questions.
