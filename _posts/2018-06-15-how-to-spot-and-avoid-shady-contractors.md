Renovating your home is no simple task. Yet, when planning to enhance your home through such projects, the cost and quality of a contractor’s work will each be important considerations in determining which expert to select for the job. 

And beyond these two points, you must also be mindful of the fact that not every contractor is reputable. Our team is always happy to recommend professionals with whom we have had previous success, but if you prefer to select a contractor on your own, there are a few red flags you should look out for. Today I would like to share six indicators that the contractor you plan on hiring may be a shady character. 

**1. They pressure you.** Contractors who are overly adamant and push you toward decisions you are uncomfortable with are among the sort you should avoid.

**2. They only accept cash.** Reputable contractors will take checks. Some may even accept credit cards. 

**3. They want the entire payment up front.** Most contractors require a down payment of 25% or 50% of the contract price for small jobs, or 10% to 33% for larger ones. If a contractor demands the entire payment before they have even begun, they may never finish the job.

**4. They have no references.** Never hire a contractor who cannot provide at least three references.

**5. They do not listen.** Contractors who are unable or unwilling to listen to your wants and needs may be difficult at best and downright unreputable at worst. 

**6. They do not make you aware of the Right of Rescission.** The law requires that if work is performed outside of an appropriate trade premise or the contractor’s place of business, you have the right to cancel your contract within three days of signing.
