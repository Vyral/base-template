Should you sell? Now that the market’s changed, is it still a good time to list your home?

The bottom line is that **if selling your home makes sense for you, then now is a good time to do it.** Home values are still significantly higher than last year, so you may have a lot of equity you could utilize.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling, call or email me, and I can set you up with a free consultation. I look forward to hearing from you.
