Today I wanted to talk to you about interviewing agents.

When you interview an agent, you want to make sure that you are getting somebody who has been in the business for a while. Recently, we have been getting a lot of new people into the market. You should make sure that if they're not on a team and also newer, that they do have somebody to help support them.

Experience in an important factor to consider. &nbsp;

For sellers looking at an agent, you should find an agent willing to help with:

1) Appropriate pricing

2) Getting the most money

3) Handling multiple offers

4) Explaining inspections and appraisals

Finding an agent who will walk you through and explain the processes of inspections and appraisals, two of the biggest hurdles to get sellers and buyers to the finish line of settlement, shows how helpful an agent can be.

I've been in the business now for 12 years and have overseen over 2,500 homes getting settled. Each year, I sell about 50 myself and my team sells 400+ units.

We have great experience, plus we will oversee all the issues that arise. We have to be problem solvers—that is how we get you to the finish line.

If you are considering interviewing people to sell your home, or are interested in interviewing us, please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions that you may have. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
