At a certain point, you don’t need a large home anymore. Maybe the kids are off to college or you’re just looking for something that requires less upkeep. In a world where bigger often seems better, sometimes less is more. Here are three benefits to downsizing with your next home:

1. More money: If you are looking to get into a smaller home than the one you have now, it frees up equity in your current home and will result in lower mortgage, tax, and insurance payments. You’ll have to spend less on upkeep and maintenance as well.
2. More time: This is a big one. A smaller home means you spend less time cleaning and upkeep. That means more time for you to do the things you like to do, like spending time with your family.
3. Increased efficiency: A smaller home needs fewer resources to heat and cool it, reducing your carbon footprint.

There are plenty more things to think about when downsizing, but most people start with asking the simple question, “What can I get for my home?” and “What kind of home could I buy in this market?”
