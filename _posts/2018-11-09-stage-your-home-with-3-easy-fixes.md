If you really want to boost buyers’ interest in your home, you’ll want to make sure it’s staged. **Here are three simple ways to make sure your home is well-staged and ready for showings:**

1. **Paint in the kitchen.** Stained and dated kitchen cabinets can be a turnoff for buyers. Don’t empty your wallet to have them replace; repaint them instead!
2. **Simplify the bedrooms.** You want to remove things that may distract buyers, allowing them to focus on the room more easily. Take out any unneeded furniture to make the room seem more spacious and uncluttered.
3. **Clean the bathroom.** Specifically, give some extra care to the showers and mirrors. More than anything else, ignoring these two areas can make a bathroom look less than stellar.

These tips won’t break the bank whatsoever, but the time you invest will pay dividends during showings. If you’d like any more information or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
