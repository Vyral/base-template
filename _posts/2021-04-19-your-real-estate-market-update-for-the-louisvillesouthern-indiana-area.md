Today’s market update is coming to you from the beautiful, sunny streets of Jamaica. I’m here shooting a future video about how travel will open up as vaccinations increase, but in the meantime, I’d like to let you know what’s going on with Louisville and Southern Indiana real estate.&nbsp;

Jamaica’s climate is a great way to sum up our market: It’s hot. To give you an example, I want to talk about a home we listed for about $700,000 about a week ago. Normally, a home in that price range could sit for a few months or even as long as a year before selling. **Well, this house received an offer within the first two hours of being listed.**

Part of this has to do with our phenomenal photography and virtual walkthrough, which you can see beginning at 0:47 in the video. We shared it on our social media networks, provided the listing information, and gained interest immediately. A person from another state contacted their Realtor, wrote the offer, and sent it our way. Our seller was going to counter the offer because it was low, but it didn’t really matter—we had four more offers that came from 10 different showings on the first day.

In another instance, we listed a home for around $200,000, had 63 showings in a single day, and had 12 offers by the end of that night. We’d already listed high, but we still got $20,000 more on top of our list price.

**Both of these situations were impressive, but seeing the $700,000 garner so much interest so quickly was truly amazing.** On top of selling so quickly, it’s making $60,000 over list price. To be fair, the house looked immaculate, and the photography/videography work truly showcased everything the listing had to offer. Regardless, they’re thrilled and so are we.

I’ll be back in the U.S. and already finished with my quarantine by the time you see this video. So, if you have any questions about our market or would like to talk about listing your home, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
