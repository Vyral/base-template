Take a look at a pug named Chloe.

Sometimes when I talk to people about their favorite lake activities, they’ll mention that they have one or more dogs and that they prefer to have a property that’s dog-friendly. Some have dogs who swim, some that will only wade waist-deep, and others that won’t go near the water at all.

In any case, I have a most unusual game of fetch to show you today. It involves a pug named Chloe. To find out if pugs can retrieve a stick before pigs can fly, watch my latest video.

In the meantime, if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
