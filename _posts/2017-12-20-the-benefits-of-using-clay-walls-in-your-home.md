I’m in a beautifully renovated bungalow for this week’s post. As soon as I walked in here, I knew it had so many amazing features that are usually reserved for homes at twice the price. The one feature that stood out to me was the American Clay walls. They are absolutely gorgeous. They were done by Patrick Allard, a local artisan and craftsman who just happens to be with us today.&nbsp;

**Patrick and his company, Ecowalls, specialize in the application of natural plasters and work with things like American Clay and lime plaster.** Both are veneers that are intended to cover existing surfaces like drywall, masonry, and certain types of wood composites.

Their company motto is “Improving your space one wall at a time” and Patrick explained a little bit more about what that means to him. There’s certainly an aesthetic component to it, but the walls that they build have even more benefits beyond that. One is a significant environmental factor. Pound for pound, clay plasters like this are the cleanest and most environmentally stable things that you can use to build or renovate your walls.

These walls bring health benefits as well. Have you ever been in the woods after a rainstorm? Something magical happens when earth and water meet, but in reality it’s all scientific. When earth and water meet in the form of vapor, negative ions are released that make you feel refreshed and relaxed at the same time. These walls are like having a natural negative ion machine in your house. **The bathroom is a perfect place for these because of the amount of humidity in there.** The mirrors will never fog, even if you forget to turn the fan on.

A few more things to note about these clay walls is that they are mold resistant, they never fade, and they reduce dust in the home via a positive static charge.&nbsp;

If you have any questions at all about these walls. **Head on over to [ecowalls.ca](ecowalls.ca) and have a look.** If you have any other questions about real estate or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
