In the state of Texas, there are certain disclosures that you are required to provide as a seller unless your home is brand new or in an estate. These disclosures cover anything and everything that has gone on in the home, from water damage to mold to any other mechanical or cosmetic issue. **You’re also required to disclose any environmental dangers that a home possesses.**

There are certain federal disclosures that also apply no matter where you live. For example, if you own a home that was built prior to 1978, you must comply with The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 and provide an addendum on your contract.

**When in doubt, disclose.** Full disclosure will protect you from future legal claims as a seller and give you more confidence in purchasing as a buyer. I’ve seen several sellers in the past fail to disclose certain things and end up being held liable for more than the cost of the home because of it.

If you have any questions about disclosures or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
