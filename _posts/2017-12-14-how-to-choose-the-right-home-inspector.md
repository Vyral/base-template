What makes a good home inspector?

As a buyer, one of the best things you can do is to work with a quality home inspector. First and foremost, **you should make sure the inspector is licensed and is a member of the American Home Inspector Institute.**

There’s also nothing wrong with calling a home inspector for an interview, to make sure you’re comfortable working with them as you move forward.

Of course, sometimes home inspectors will tell us things we aren’t so happy to hear. But ultimately, that’s a good thing. Home inspectors look at everything in the home we wouldn’t think to look at ourselves.

When you have a home inspection performed, the inspector may flag some things for you to have looked at more thoroughly by another specialized professional.

Even if there’s nothing glaringly wrong, **it’s a good idea to have specialists come and look at specific areas of the home.**
