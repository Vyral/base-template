If you are looking to sell your home, it’s important to know how to market it. Today, we will go over one strategy and answer the question, “Are open houses a good way to market your house?”

<br>In our opinion, **open houses are a great way to market and sell a home.** In fact, it’s our third best lead source when attracting buyers to homes we have listed. However, not all agents share our views.

<br>A lot of agents will tell you not to do an open house because it’s a waste of time and not worth it. Unfortunately, if you hear this from an agent, it probably means they are just lazy. They don’t want to put all the signs out, and **they don’t want to give up their weekend to show your home.**

<br>Don’t be fooled. We have found open houses to be a fabulous source for generating buyers and getting top dollar for our sellers. We attribute this to our “out of box strategy.” The first thing we do to implement this strategy is mail invitations to the whole neighborhood and surrounding areas a week before the showing. We then personally go door to door and invite people in the community. We also run social media advertisements to make sure the whole community is aware of the showing.

<br>On the day of the open house, **your neighbors are going to really benefit you.** They want your house to sell for top dollar, because that will raise the value of their homes. They might even know someone that wants to move into the neighborhood. Also, there’s a chance a renter will turn into a buyer if they have fallen in love with the neighborhood and want to stay.

<br>If you would like to find out more about how our open house strategy will sell your home, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would be more than happy to answer any questions you have!
