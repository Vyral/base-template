I have worked with so many wonderful clients over the years, including Chris Cannon. Today, I wanted to share Chris’s story with you all:

“We first met Brad in 2002, when he helped us buy a duplex. That’s the property we now live in, after it paid its own mortgage. We also inherited a triplex in Glendale. We sold our portion and, after five years, Brad moved us into an eight-unit complex, which also pays for itself.”

“We’ve been very happy with Brad and his team. They seem to work very diligently. They also hooked us up with a management company, so we have no worries. They take care of the late night calls, advertising, and any repairs that might be needed.”

If you have any questions about real estate or are interested in working with us, please give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
