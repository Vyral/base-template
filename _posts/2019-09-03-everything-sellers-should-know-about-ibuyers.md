Recently, you’ve probably seen a lot of companies popping up with offers to buy homes outright for cash. Businesses like Opendoor and the up-and-coming Zillow Offers are leaders in this industry, but **the truth is that most of these iBuyers (or “internet buyers”) aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.**&nbsp;

While using an iBuyer can be a faster alternative to selling on the open market, it isn’t actually all that more convenient. Not only do sellers who sell to iBuyers earn less for their home, but they also pay service fees and repair credits. When all is said and done, **sellers usually end up selling for 13% to 15% less than they could have earned had they listed on the open market.&nbsp;**

This isn’t to say that there aren’t any circumstances in which selling to an iBuyer would be a smart move. If you don’t care about sacrificing a little equity and need to get your home sold in a very short time frame, then working with one of these companies might be a good idea.&nbsp;

However, our team does have a fantastic alternative for sellers faced with this kind of situation. We can connect you with multiple guaranteed offers. It’s also important to note that, unless your home is move-in ready, you won’t generally qualify for typical iBuyer offers.&nbsp;

Our team understands this, but we also understand the draw of a convenient sale. **This is why we work hard to strike a balance between a convenient and lucrative experience for our clients.&nbsp;**

Whatever your goal may be, we want to help you get the best possible results. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
