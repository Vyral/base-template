I get asked quite a bit about capital gains taxes when selling a property, so today I want to talk about how you can avoid them if you’re selling a property.&nbsp;

Let me preface this discussion by saying that I’m a Realtor—not an accountant. You need to verify all of this information with your accountant and work with them before you make any decisions related to this scenario.&nbsp;

Now, let’s say you own a property that’s worth $800,000 but you bought it for $400,000 back at the downturn of 2008 or 2009. Clearly there’s been a lot of appreciation on this property, and now you’re getting ready to sell it to buy something else. How much of that $400,000 in appreciation will you end up paying in capital gains?

**One thing you get to subtract is your closing costs.**Let’s say selling it at $800,000 would net you $50,000 worth of closing costs. **Y******ou** also get to subtract capital improvements**, which we’ll say are &nbsp;worth $20,000 in this example. Those two subtractions put you at $330,000.&nbsp;

From here, we’ll delve into two different scenarios.&nbsp;

If the house in this example if your primary residence and you’ve lived in the property for the last five years, you’re protected for up to $250,000. Subtracting that amount from the $330,000 puts you at $80,000.

If you’re married and both parties have lived in the house for the last five years, then you’re protected for up to $500,000, which would put you at minus $170,000. In that case, you wouldn’t pay any capital gains when you shift your money from one property to the next.&nbsp;

Why is this so important? A lot of it has to do with timing. If you sell your property after a year and 10 months instead of two years, you’ll pay a lot more in capital gains. When you sell a property, **pay attention to the timing and make certain you consider the capital gains cost in that sale.** You want to figure out as close as possible how much money you’re going to take from one purchase to the next. If it means waiting a couple extra months, it’s well worth it.&nbsp;
