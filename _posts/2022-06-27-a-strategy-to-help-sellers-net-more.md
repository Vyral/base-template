If you’re planning to sell your home, we have a strategy that will help you attract more buyers without reducing your list price.

A week or so ago, we had a seller who wanted more offers on their home but didn’t want to reduce their price. Instead of encouraging a price reduction, we presented them with another option called a buydown. **A buydown is when the seller gives the buyer a lender credit that lets them buy their interest rate down.** This makes it easier for your buyers to purchase your home and widens your buying pool without you taking a hit on price.

Now keep in mind that our market is changing. It’s not crashing by any means, but it is correcting. There are now fewer buyers and more sellers. The market is simply correcting and is starting to resemble a more normal market.

If you have questions about the buydown strategy or anything else to do with real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you.
