**Today I’m joined by Brian Linchey of Mason-McDuffie Mortgage to talk about a strategy that you can use to get more buyers interested in your home.**

Let’s say that you have a property that’s listed for $1 million and it’s just not selling. The first thing that you’re probably going to think about doing is reducing the price. However, one strategy that Brian has used before is **an interest buydown, which allows the buyer to be able to reduce their mortgage payment and allows the seller to avoid making a price reduction.**

If you had that same $1 million listing and reduced its price to $960,000, the seller is going to be accepting less money. Instead of losing that $40,000 though, you could pay a couple of points to buy down the buyer’s interest rate. That might only cost a seller $22,000 instead of $40,000.

**The benefits of this are significant on both sides.** It lowers the interest rate by up to ¾ of a point, which can have a significant impact on the buyer’s monthly payment. By lowering that payment, you can also open yourself up to buyers that might not have been looking for your home at first or may not have qualified for it without the buydown. It’s really a win-win situation.

Another strategy could be to use both. Maybe you do a slight, $10,000 price reduction and let the market know about it, while also doing a $15,000 interest buydown. 

If you’re a buyer or seller and you’d like to look into this strategy more, don’t hesitate to reach out to Brian at [(925) 231-4311](tel:(925) 231-4311){: target="_blank"} or [blinchey@masonmac.com](mailto:blinchey@masonmac.com).

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
