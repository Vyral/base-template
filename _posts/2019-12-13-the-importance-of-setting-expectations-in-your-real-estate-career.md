<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Setting expectations on your team is critical, and today I’ll discuss why.</em></p>

In any business, setting expectations is key—and this is especially true when you’re part of a real estate team. After all, **the mutual success of everyone on that team depends on clear communication about the goals and strategies everyone holds.** That’s why, today, I’d like to share what I expect of the people who work with me.

Personally speaking, I’ve recently done a lot of reflection on how my teammates can win and lose with me, and have found that both of these things are closely tied to Keller Williams’ Six Personal Perspectives.

For instance, **victim language always rubs me the wrong way.** It’s a deep-rooted pet peeve of mine to hear people blaming external influences on their personal success. On the flip side, I’m always happy to work and grow with people who hold themselves accountable. It’s all a matter of mindset.&nbsp;

Of course, there are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you *can* control. That’s how you win with me.&nbsp;

**If you focus on what matters, admit accountability, and do what it takes to move yourself forward, it will be much easier for us to communicate effectively.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have any questions or would like more information about setting expectations or effective communication, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
