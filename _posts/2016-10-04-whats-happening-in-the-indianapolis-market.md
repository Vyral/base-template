What’s going on in the Indianapolis real estate market right now?
<br>
<br>First, **we are currently in a seller’s market.**This means that there are fewer houses listed on the market than there are buyers to purchase those homes.
<br>
<br>Due to the low number of homes on the market for sale, the prices for the properties available have increased. Home sellers can sell their house right now for top dollar and get full asking price for their home. In some cases, they’ll even get above asking price.
<br>
<br>What should you do if you’re a home buyer in a hot seller’s market like this one? **First of all, you’ll need to act fast.** If or when you see a property on the market that you’re interested in, make sure you’re ready to make a decision.
<br>
<br>Due to the limited inventory, **you’ll also probably have less negotiating power than you would in a balanced market.** This means that you’ll probably have to pay full price for the home you want. If you’re in a multiple offer situation, you may even need to pay above asking price.
<br>
<br>Interest rates are still very low, however, which has a positive effect on your buying power. Even if you end up paying full asking price or above for a home, it’s still likely that your monthly mortgage payment for the home will be affordable.
