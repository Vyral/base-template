Jennie recently headed to the Greenwood District to connect with Joyce, aka Cobbler Mom, to learn more about the delicious treats she is dishin' out to Tulsans.

Inspired at a young age by her mother and grandmother baking she was determined to learnt the same skills, just one problem….they didn’t measure ingredients!

Thanks to a patients of an aunt who saw Joyce’s passion, she taught her the family recipe for crust, making it the foundation of her culinary adventure.

Oh and that’s not all, Joyce is more than a baker providing beans and cornbread, beef tips and cabbage, and even turkey pastrami as lunch and dinner options.

Cobbler Mom is open 5 days a week from 11:00am- 6:00pm, Tuesday - Saturday.
