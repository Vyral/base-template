We’re watching a few things in the market very closely this year that will, depending on what happens, have a big impact for most buyers and sellers.

1. **Interest rates.** The Fed recently raised rates, and the market did not react kindly. Now it seems as though the Fed is going to take the wait-and-see position for potential future hikes, which has quelled a few fears.
2. **Oil prices.** Even though Houston is a very diversified city, we still have a lot things that are affected by oil. As you might already know, we saw a pretty big decrease in oil pricing last year, but we seem to be holding steady at the moment.
3. **New tax laws.** We believe that some of the people from higher-priced areas where property taxes are also high will be looking for tax shelters. The Lone Star State is definitely on a lot of people’s lists for that, so we’ll see if that gives us an influx of buyers.

**In the national market, we’re seeing three very interesting trends:**

1. **There will be more homes to sell.** We’ve been in a huge seller’s market for a long time, and we’re starting to see that shift. Many markets in the nation have shifted from an extreme seller’s market to more of a buyer’s market. This is very pronounced in a lot of area luxury markets.
2. **As prices go up, there is less availability of entry-level homes.** We’re seeing that a sizeable portion of would-be buyers are having to sit on the sidelines, as increased prices and rising interest rates are making first-time home purchases difficult for many people.
3. **Millennials are the dominant buyers on the market.** The younger generation who, years ago, were thought to be disinterested in buying and selling homes now make up 45% of all mortgages. For reference, baby boomers only make up 17%, and Generation X makes up 37%. Since millennials grew up in the time of great technological innovation, agents are having to rearrange how we do our marketing and focus on staying in front of them in the digital realm.

On my next video, I’ll discuss some specifics about what to expect here in the Houston area. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to address any questions or concerns you have.<br>&nbsp;
