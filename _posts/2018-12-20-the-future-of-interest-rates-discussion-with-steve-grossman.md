According to Steve, these recent rate increases were forecasted. Additionally, it’s expected that the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates three times in the next 12 to 18 months. This will have an impact on short-term rates; as far as mortgage rates, who’s to say what will happen with the economy?

Mortgages for new purchases in the United States equal roughly 80% of all transactions, meaning that 20% are refinances. But with interest rates going up, why would someone refinance?

Well, no matter where rates are, people will always refinance. There are a variety of people who choose this option: Some people’s credit isn’t up to speed and they can’t take advantage of low rates; others have been looking at their home as a source of equity and are refinancing to take cash out or to consolidate their debts.

Many of Steve’s clients have decided that since **they’re not planning to live in their current home for 30 years, they’ll take out an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), because ARMs will be much less than the fixed-rate mortgages.** This was the case back when rates were around 3%. Now, however, we’re seeing that mortgage rates are climbing higher than the ARMs are able to adjust to.

ARMs are reset every year, so as interest rates decline, the individuals with these mortgages get the benefit of a low initial rate. Now, as the short-term rates have risen over the last two years, the ARMs are getting higher. With the way that the short-term rates are, as well as the margins on these loans, many consumers are paying full index rates higher than what you can get on a current fixed-rate mortgage or on another adjustable-rate loan. So, right now, if they fully index at about 5% and the forecasts come to fruition, these ARMs will reset in the next 18 months or so to as high as 5.75%.

Where does Steve think that the mortgage rates are going to go? His honest answer: He has no clue. **Historically, when we enter a recessionary period, the Fed steps in and lowers interest rates, so as long as no external forces cause the Fed to step in, the rates will continue to rise.** Such an external force would be something like we saw back in 2008 when the banking crisis occurred, or if gas prices were to soar. As it is right now, however, rates are scheduled to go up.

If interest rates rise 0.25% to 0.5%, what does that mean for buyers? For example, if a buyer is purchasing a house for $1 million and they put 20% down, what will the difference be for their monthly payment? According to Steve, if rates go up 0.5%, their monthly payment would be about $250 more.

The message here is that **things aren’t all so bad**. Bear in mind that interest rates are still historically very low right now. It’s down to the consumer to decide whether or not that $250 extra each month would be a manageable expense. If the rates do rise, people will likely go back to an adjustable-rate mortgage to keep their payments in a feasible range. Remember: What goes up will eventually come down, and at that point, you’ll have an opportunity to refinance.

Since rates are still historically low, this might provide some opportunities with ARMs. At the very least, they’re worth considering, depending on the size of the loan, how long someone plans to live in that house, and what their risk tolerance is.

Sometimes during a transaction, a seller will look at a buyer’s down payment and think that a higher down payment means that the buyer is more qualified. Is this an accurate way to think?<br><br>Not necessarily, says Steve. All other things being equal, you have to consider whether or not the buyer’s credit is good, if their debt-to-income ratio is reasonable, and so on. The seller, in many instances, feels that if the house under-appraises, the buyer with a 30% down payment is still going to buy the house, but that doesn’t mean that the buyer won’t want to renegotiate. It’s the same with someone putting down 20%—**you can’t just look at their down payment, but also their creditworthiness**. You also need to recognize that there will always be a value concern on the buyer’s part, regardless of a buyer’s down payment size.

On a final note, Steve and the New Jersey Lenders are local lenders—so what is the main benefit of working with a local lender?

Local lenders also tend to work with local appraisers. These appraisers are familiar with the market, and since value is a concern on the buyers’ part, **their knowledge of the local market will be a boon to both parties in a transaction.**
