As you know by now, the real estate market in our area has been pretty sluggish. I discussed in my last video how since the oil prices went down, the market went down with it.

We have a lot of inventory, but demand is not as high here as it is in other areas. **How then can you get multiple offers on a home in order to sell it above asking price in a buyer’s market?** I will share my secrets with you.

When we get a call from a client asking us to help them sell their home, **the first thing we do is meet the client, analyze the home, and stage it**. We do our best to polish the home to increase curb appeal and make it shine. After that, we take professional photos so that your listing will stand out to potential buyers looking for homes.

Once we get to the point of listing your home, **we often list it at just slightly less than the market price**. What does that do?

It means that if you have three or four homes on your street that are competing with your home, **yours will be the best-looking one, have the best pictures, and have the best price**. Doing this will create demand for your home, where there was little or none before.

Hopefully, fantastic condition and price will cause everyone to want to come see your home. Within one or two days, you will see a lot of activity from curious buyers, and now that demand exists, **you will begin to receive multiple offers.**

Since everyone submitting offers is likely serious about getting your home, they will keep bidding over each other, raising the price you will eventually sell the home for.

That is my secret to quickly selling your home over asking price with multiple offers even in a buyer’s market. If you are interested in selling your home and are curious about what your home can sell for, please feel free to give me a call. Together, we will get you multiple offers on your home.
