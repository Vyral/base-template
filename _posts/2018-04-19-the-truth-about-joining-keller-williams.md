One of Keller Williams’ newer agents, Justin Yoder, sat down recently to share his experience.

Justin was previously a top-producing agent at a small company and was looking for a chance to expand his horizons. That’s when he came to Keller Williams. “I wanted to reach a new ceiling,” said Justin. **“I came to Keller Williams because they have a system of highly successful agents.”**

According to Justin, the professionals on our team have done a great job helping him put his goals into action.

Justin isn’t new to real estate. In fact, he’s been in the business full-time for 14 years. “I care deeply about making sure that my clients don’t get just any home, but the right one,” says Justin. One of the main things that sets Justin apart as a Realtor is his ability to problem-solve and negotiate for his clients.

“There are a lot of buyers out there who are making offers and aren’t getting homes. My clients are getting contracts. It’s not always about the highest price. Sometimes it’s asking what’s important to the seller and making sure that my client can do that,” says Justin.

Justin may be highly skilled at what he does, but he also recognizes that there are some common fears held by real estate agents. Inconsistency, in particular, is something he says many agents worry about. On top of that, many professionals in the real estate industry have fears about lacking support.

**But, thanks to the guidance provided by Keller Williams’ training programs, KW agents don’t have to worry about either of these fears.**

Justin feels that at his brokerage, specifically, he can call the owners directly at any time. He knows his team’s leaders are there to help him. “One of the best things about KW is having people willing to help you,” said Justin

These days, Justin says that he stretches himself to meet goals he once wouldn’t have believed were possible.
