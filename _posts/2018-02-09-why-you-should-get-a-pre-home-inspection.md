Today, I’d like to talk to you about what you need to know, as a future home seller, about pre-home inspections.

When you’re getting ready to list your property, we can give you a list of home inspectors who we know and like. The cost will be in the $300 to $400 range. They’ll come out to look at everything to make sure there aren’t any surprises that buyers may come across. That way, **the buyer won’t come back asking for a discounted price** for some malfunction they discovered.

Another reason to get a pre-home inspection is that when you go under contract, there are only so many days to negotiate the home inspections and the resolution period. As a seller, you may only have three to five days to get estimates. If you take care of it ahead of time, you won’t have to rush through to get things done. Additionally, **it helps you get a good price for your home** to make any repairs that come up during the inspection.

The buyer may still do their own inspection, but with a pre-home inspection, **you can say that you’ve already disclosed everything.** It will make the buyer feel better about your home.

If you need a list of trusted inspectors or have any further questions, feel free to reach out anytime.
