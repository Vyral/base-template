We recently had our client appreciation night at Riverbat Stadium, and I would just like to say thanks to everyone who came out to celebrate with us. Our clients received tickets, gift bags, and had photos taken with our roaming photo booth.

**Client appreciation nights give us a chance to reconnect with past clients and learn more about current clients.** We love hearing stories about how we were able to help our clients, and we hope everyone had a great time at Riverbat Stadium. Please check out 3:18 in our video to see all the great photos we took with our clients\!

If you'd like to become one of our clients and attend other celebrations that we host, or if you have any other questions, give me a call anytime at 502-376-5483. Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
