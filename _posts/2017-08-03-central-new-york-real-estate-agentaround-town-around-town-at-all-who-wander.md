If craft beer and good company is your idea of a good night on the town, you’ll like today’s local business spotlight.

I’m talking about All Who Wander, a craft beer bar and grill at 315 Fayette St. According to co-owners Dan Chapman and Joe Ori, the name “All Who Wander” speaks to the experience of finding your place to enjoy a nice craft beverage, a grilled cheese sandwich, and having a nice social experience. For them, it’s as simple as taking the products that they love and sharing them with their customers.

Speaking of products, **they not only have wine and many regional beers on tap, but also on-tap nitro coffee.** If you haven’t heard of this new trend, nitro coffee is cold-brew coffee infused with nitrogen so it pours out of a tap just like a Guinness would. It adds a silky, smooth flavor that’s nothing short of delicious on a warm day.

**All of the craft beers they serve are hand-selected by Dan and Joe.** They consider it a very important part of their job to represent the beer itself and share with people the way certain beers are supposed to taste. Furthermore, the history and story of the beer brings more to the drinking experience (I call this “knowledge-based drinking”). One of the fulfilling things about their work is sharing stories back and forth with their customers.

To know more about All Who Wander, you can visit them online at <a href="http://www.wanderhere.com/" target="_blank">www.wanderhere.com</a> or send them an email at <a href="mailto:letstalk@wanderhere.com">letstalk@wanderhere.com</a>.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
