I’ve been getting a lot of questions about the home selling process lately, so I wanted to take you through it step by step.

The first step is the most important. You need to choose an agent, but not just any agent. Interviewing multiple agents in order to find the right one is the best strategy. Find out what their marketing plan is, what their business is like, and what their list-to-sale price ratio is. **These are a few of the most telling things you can learn from an agent.**

The next thing to do is will sit down and decide on a price. **To do that, we will look at many things, including the age, condition, and location of their home.** If your home is sitting on a corner lot or next to a busy boulevard, that can affect its value positively or negatively. We also look at the amenities of your home.

After a price is decided, it's time to get the home’s condition up to par. Decluttering and staging are important steps in getting the home ready for a showing at a moment’s notice.

Finally, we’ll get your home sold. We'll review any offers, go through the inspection, and negotiate any repairs with the buyer. Then, we’ll help you plan your move.

**That’s just a small taste of what the home selling process is like.** If you have any questions for us or want to learn more about it, don't’ hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
