Not everyone will understand right away all the work we do on their transaction. A lot of professionals like to openly question why they should hire a real estate agent if they could just do everything online anyway.

Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?

You’ve probably encountered this situation before.

You have a client come to an open house who is a professional, whether it be a lawyer, doctor, or accountant, and they say something like this: “You real estate agents sure make a lot of money. Why do I need to hire you if I can just use the internet and sites like Zillow to buy and sell homes?”

**If you run into this situation, here’s what you have to do.** You have to help them see it from a perspective that they can relate to. Let’s say the person asking you this question is a doctor. A good answer would be something like this. “As a physician, why would I need you? I can go to WebMD, figure out what kind of prescription I might need, go down to Mexico and get it, and medicate myself.”

Maybe it’s because there is a chance things could go wrong. Something bad could happen, and you could get really sick by trying to save a few bucks. **Things can go wrong in the real estate transaction the same way.** You might not get sick by not hiring an agent, but you could really get taken advantage of when buying or selling.

In order to win with a professional client, you need to establish yourself as a professional as well.

I hope this tip helps. If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out and give me a call or shoot me an email. I hope to talk to you soon!
