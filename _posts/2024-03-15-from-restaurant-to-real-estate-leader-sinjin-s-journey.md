Hi! Sinjin Martin here, Sales Director at Dave Hooke Real Estate Team. Today, I would like to share my real estate journey and how it changed my life.

My journey into real estate started in 2016. I'd been working at a local restaurant, Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, for about ten years, but I realized it wasn't the right fit for my future. I wanted to start a family, get married, and have kids, but late hours at work didn't align with the life I envisioned.

So, I had a chat with my parents, who had been involved in real estate, and it seemed like a good fit for me. I got licensed and started out on my own as an independent agent. **I enjoyed connecting with people and helping them find homes,** but there were parts of the job, like paperwork, that didn't energize me.

After about three years on my own, I got engaged and started thinking about my future. I had a conversation with a friend, Joe Richmond, whom I now work closely with every day. He mentioned an opportunity to join a great team, which I hadn't considered before. It seemed like the perfect chance to focus on **what I loved about real estate—helping people find homes**—while getting support with the parts I didn't enjoy as much.

I joined Dave Hooke’s team about 14 months ago, and since then, I've moved up the ladder from a buyer's agent to a listing agent, and now I'm the sales director. **It's exciting because I've been able to align my career goals with my life goals** with the help of my wife. This new role allows me to empower my colleagues and give back to the team that has supported me.

Looking ahead, I feel confident about the future because I've laid out a clear plan with one-, three-, five-, and ten-year goals. My wife and I talk about it often and dream together, which gets us excited. Having a path and a supportive team around me makes the future look bright.
