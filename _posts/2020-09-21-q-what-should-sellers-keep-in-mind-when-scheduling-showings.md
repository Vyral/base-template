<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why it’s so important for sellers to be flexible when it comes to scheduling showings.</em></p>

One of the most important things we talk about with our selling clients is the fact that they need to be flexible when it comes to scheduling showings. That means, **when your home goes on the market, you’ll have to set your personal lifestyle aside so that you can make your home always look show-ready.**

According to my business partner Laura Jones, the process is usually a bit more work than many sellers realize. Buyers have many things going on in their own lives, as do their agents, such that balancing everyone’s schedule can be difficult. Many buyers end up blocking off a limited four-hour period to go view homes. During this period, Laura can schedule showings of multiple properties in a row, which means that she has to stay right on time.

If a property was unavailable at the requested time (which doesn’t often happen), **then the property often falls off the buyer’s radar**—they often find the home they want within the first couple of days when they start viewing houses.&nbsp;

It takes about four or five days for a client of Laura’s to go from being just a lead to actually getting in the car to go out for a showing. During this time, they compile and fine-tune a list of houses the buyer is interested in, and 48 hours before going to a showing, she puts together a schedule of showings for the properties that were narrowed down. That’s why it’s critical for sellers to be flexible with their own schedules; failure to be open could result in losing buyers.
