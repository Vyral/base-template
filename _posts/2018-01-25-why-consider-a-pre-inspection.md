Traditionally, when a home seller accepts a contract, the offer is subject to a seven-to 10-day inspection period. During the inspection, a buyer will go through the home with their inspector and find out any and everything that’s wrong with the house. **They then ask the seller to repair a list of items that have to be completed by a licensed, bonded professional.**

The problem that we’ve found with traditional inspections is that they cause a lot of transactions to fall apart. In fact, about 20% of all homes that go under contract fail to reach the closing table for this reason. When you have to go back on the market after a deal falls apart, most buyers tend to think there’s something wrong with the house, especially if it comes on after the inspection period.

**A pre-listing inspection helps the process by identifying problems early so that you don’t have that awkward negotiation**. You can simply fix the things that are going to show up on the report before the buyer or their inspector has a chance to see them.

If you have any questions for me about pre-listing inspections or inspections in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
