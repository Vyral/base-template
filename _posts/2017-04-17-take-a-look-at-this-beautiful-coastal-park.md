Today I’m coming to you from the beautiful Emerald Coast. My son and I are at Topsail State Park, one of our favorite state parks in Florida. It has the most beautiful trails and it really sets your mind free to be here. It’s a spot to really think about the important things in life.

**Topsail State Park is just one of the many parks throughout 30a, and we can help you discover all of the great parks Florida has to offer.**

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
