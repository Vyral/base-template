*How do real estate conventions help my team and I perform better for our clients? Today I’m bringing you those answers from one I recently attended in Las Vegas.*

Today I’m in Las Vegas at the Tom Ferry Success Summit—a real estate convention.

Real estate conventions are something we engage in frequently because doing so helps us maintain our constant commitment to being on the cutting edge of real estate.

Technology is a large portion of this. **In fact, Zillow, Google, and others are here at this same convention, where I have been for the past week.**

It’s incredibly important for us to make our buyer and seller transactions even smoother.

One of the ways we achieve this is by networking with other Realtors. Recently, for example, I sat down for a drink and conversation with an HGTV star who actually works in Portland.

**Being face to face with these fellow professionals really helps me to build a larger database.** This means that whether our clients are looking to move to another state or even another country, I can help refer them to the right agent.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
