**“How will I know that I’m buying a good house and not one that’s a downright money pit?”**

That question comes up occasionally when we’re speaking with buyers, so today I’d like to shed light on how you can rest assured that you’re protected when you buy a home with any of our agents. This is how we protect your interest:&nbsp;

**In any and all offers we write, we make sure there’s built-in negotiation for a home inspection.** We work jointly with qualified, reputable professionals who are out examining properties each and every day and are skilled at spotting things that might go unnoticed by the untrained eye.

They’ll check all areas of the home including, but not limited to, the crawlspace, the attic, and underneath the sink as well as the plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems. Once their report is complete, they’ll supply you with pictures and full descriptions of any potentially concerning items.&nbsp;

Our inspectors are so thorough, in fact, that the length of the report may seem a little overwhelming, but not to worry—a lot of their findings won’t necessarily be high-priority items. That leads me right into my next point: **It’s important for you to go through the whole report and make note of any serious concerns, and your agent will help in this way.&nbsp;**

**The second protection we offer, specifically to our preferred clients, is our “Love It or Leave It” Program** for buyers who’ve made a purchase with us. If at any point in the first year of living in your newly purchased home you realize that you made a mistake or there’s some glaring issue you weren’t aware of, such as noisy neighbors, we’ll happily resell your home without charging you any commission. And all you have to do is utilize our services in buying another property in our market. &nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this program, how we protect your interest as a homebuyer, or anything else related to real estate, please let us know. We’re always here to help\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
