<center><em>There&rsquo;s an eastward migration happening in our market.</em></center>

<br>Today’s topic can be summed up in one sentence: Go east, young man.

Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a lot of people moving from the Bay Area to the Central Valley due to more and more companies allowing their workers to work from home (and to a lesser extent, low interest rates). This has had a big impact on our market. We’ve seen a huge influx of young buyers who don’t have to live in higher-priced areas anymore—areas where they had previously been renters.

This has been a welcome improvement to our market because **sellers are benefiting tremendously and home prices are rising**. Every property we listed the week before the recording of this video attracted multiple offers and sold above asking price. Additionally, many home sellers in our area are moving even further east and settling in the Midwest.

If you’ve been thinking about leaving California and moving to another state but are still on the fence about selling, give us a call. We’d love to talk more about why now’s an optimal time to sell. There are far more buyers than there are sellers out there, so **it’s a great time to get top dollar**.
