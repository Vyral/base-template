Home sellers, and their agents, want their properties to remain show-ready at all times while they’re on the market; but ensuring that this is the case can be a chore—especially if said sellers have already moved out.

**Whose job is it to pick up the newspaper, shovel the driveway, and keep the grass trimmed?**

Unfortunately, it usually isn’t feasible for a seller who has already moved away to take care of these daily or weekly tasks. So whose shoulders does this home maintenance fall on?

Well, until the property has sold, its condition remains the responsibility of the seller. Buyers will lose interest and neighbors will become testy if your home becomes an eye-sore.&nbsp;

**Don’t assume your real estate agent is your gardener or maid.** Even though they also have a vested interest in making sure your home sells quickly and at a high price, it isn’t their job to stay on top of its general upkeep. Some agents may be up to the task, but you shouldn’t presume this to be the case until you’ve had a candid discussion about it.&nbsp;

Some agents may refuse to take responsibility for these tasks not because they mind doing the work, but because they don’t want to be blamed in case anything goes wrong.&nbsp;

In general, **the best way to ensure a vacant home is well-maintained while its on the market is to hire relevant contractors or a property manager to take care of the necessary tasks.** Your agent will likely be happy to help coordinate the fine details so long as you, the seller, are the one taking bids and making payments. A good agent will also often have a network of vendors with whom they can connect their seller, if necessary.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that, **no matter the situation, a quality real estate agent will have your best interests at heart** and will be more than willing to guide you through whatever obstacles you encounter during your home selling experience.&nbsp;
