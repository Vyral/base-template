Today we’d like to introduce Evelyn, the receptionist (and your first point of contact) at Success Mortgage Partners.

Evelyn has worked at Success Mortgage Partners since September of 2016. **As a receptionist, she is your first point of contact when you inquire about an application.** She makes sure that you get the application and will answer your questions as well.

“What I enjoy most is learning everything that I didn’t know before,” Evelyn says. “I have been able to soak in a lot of information about the mortgage process that I didn’t know before, so it’s been a really good experience so far.”

“Kristin has a lot of knowledge and she will do everything she can to help you get a new home,” Evelyn adds.

One thing Evelyn thinks that everyone should know about the mortgage process is that **the whole process depends on you.** “We will do everything we can on our end,” says Evelyn, “But it really depends on when we get your information. The quicker you send us your information, the faster we can start the whole process.”

If you have any other questions for our team, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
