## **Youth at Heart: Nurturing Tulsa's Future**

We recently connected with Sara, the CEO and President of Tulsa nonprofit,Youth at Heart, dedicated to making a positive impact on Tulsa’s youth.

**More Than Just After-School Care**

Youth at Heart offers a comprehensive range of programs, including academic support, enrichment activities, recreation, and field trips. These programs are essential for children who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities.

Sara emphasized the significant financial burden that childcare costs can place on families. By providing free after-school programs, Youth at Heart is not only enriching the lives of children but also providing much-needed relief to their families.

**Building Strong Communities**

One of the organization’s strengths lies in its ability to build strong partnerships with schools. By collaborating with teachers and administrators, Youth at Heart can align its programs with classroom curriculum, creating a seamless learning experience for students.

Youth at Heart also employs many part-time staff members, often teachers, who are passionate about working with young people. This dedication to quality staffing ensures that children receive the best possible care and support.

**How You Can Help**

Youth at Heart relies on the support of the Tulsa community to continue its vital work. While financial contributions are always appreciated, spreading awareness about the organization is equally important.

By sharing Youth at Heart’s story, you can help connect more families with the resources they need to thrive.
