Our team has had a record year and will likely be growing. Here’s how you can get involved.

I am happy to be joined today by Amy Schafer, our lead buyer’s agent, to talk a little about our team and how we help those who are interested in a career in real estate get started.

This year has been crazy. It’s been a record year for our team. **Since we’ve been growing so fast, we have been getting a lot of questions about how to get into the industry.** We’ve got a lot of different roles on our team, and some of them don’t even require a real estate license.

We have a school here at Keller Williams to help you get licensed if real estate is a career you’re considering. **We have regular career nights here at KW and also teach a live class for the 60-hour pre-license.** We also teach listing practices, buying practices, and developing professional ethics, which are the three classes you need to complete to get your license.

**The total time for the classes is 96 hours, but we make it fun with Amy as your instructor.** Another good contact for you to have if you’re thinking about a career in real estate is the Professional Licensing Bureau, which deals with the Iowa Real Estate Commission. Gaby, our agent services coordinator, is also available to help walk you through the process.

If you have any questions for us or would like to talk about getting a career started in real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We can send you some information so you can determine if it’s the right fit for you. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
