What’s your home really worth? Is it a good time to sell in our market?

As far as finding out what your home is worth, it’s very easy to go online and get a general valuation, but it’s always best to call your agent for a customized report of your home’s value. To answer the second question, inventory is really low right now, so the simple economics of supply and demand say yes, it is a good time to sell.

To get top dollar for your home sale, we have a couple pointers for you.

First, **let us come into your home and give it a room-by-room evaluation free of charge.**In doing this, we give you a fresh look at your home through buyers’ eyes and tell you what upgrades and repairs you can make that will give you the best return possible. If you spend a dollar, you don’t want to only get a dollar back—you want to get $3, $5, or even $10 back.
