When we get ready to put a home on the market, we use four different data points to determine the price we should list it at. **Each one gets us closer to that sweet spot where the home will sell quickly and for a great price:**

**1. What are the homes selling for in your immediate area?** We take a look at all the homes that are currently on the market and where they are listed, as well as the prices from all of the home sales in the last six to nine months.<br><br>**2. The tax value.**What we’re looking for here is the ratio that homes are selling in your area compared to their tax-assessed value.

**3. What does Zillow say your home is worth?** Most homeowners understand that Zillow’s valuations aren’t entirely accurate, but they are another good way to measure yourself up against the competition.

**4. How does your home compare to those other homes?** This is when we look at things like the conditions and the upgrades that your home has and other homes don’t, or vice versa. It also gives us a good idea of what the current market looks like in your area.

All of these pieces go into determining where that sweet spot is where we can get your home sold in the shortest amount of time for the most money possible. If you have any questions or any real estate needs that we can assist with, watch this short video.
