When you get a home inspection, your first step is to make sure you pick them properly by making sure they're a member of the National Association of Home Inspectors, or NAHA. They have standards for practice as well as a code of ethics that members must follow.

Inspectors only have to be licensed in the state, so there's no additional training they have to go through. Being a member of the NAHA makes a big difference in the way they carry themselves and conduct your inspection because of the standards of practice.

<br>Home inspections seek to find what we call 'material defects,' which means anything that adversely affects the value of a home. Home inspections don't look for cosmetic flaws like stains in the carpet or cracked drywall, though. Material defects will occur with things like the mechanical systems, the roof, window, or electrical systems, among many others. These things can adversely affect the value of your home, which is why they want to address them.

We also recommend that you attend the home inspection. That way, you'll understand what the inspector is going over at the end when you get the inspection report. They can even answer questions during or immediately after the inspection.

The inspector also looks for safety items like fire hazards or electrical issues. Once you get the report, you want to review it to see if there's anything you need to address as a buyer or seller.

As a buyer, you can ask the seller to fix material defects or ask for a credit.

All in all, we strongly recommend inspections because they can help you avoid a lot of issues down the road. If you have any questions about home inspections or you're thinking about selling your Philadelphia home, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be glad to help!
