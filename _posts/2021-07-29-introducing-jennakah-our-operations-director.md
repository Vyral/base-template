Today I’m here again with another team member spotlight. We’re highlighting one of the most important leaders on our team, Operations Director Jennakah Cloward.&nbsp;

**Dave: How did you end up partnering with our team?**

Jennakah: I’ve been here a long time. I started working with the team in high school. I started as an office administrator, and now I work as operations director. At this point, I’ve been here for 13 years, which is about half my life.&nbsp;

From start to finish, you’ve been on a journey to leadership. **Since you’ve had a lot of positions here, why don’t you go through them for us?&nbsp;**

I started off answering the phones and filing paperwork, so pretty standard stuff. From there, I became Dave’s assistant for a year or two before moving to transaction coordinator when he started his team. Finally, I’ve been operations director for about two years.&nbsp;

You’ve become one of our most important leaders on the team. Since you’ve been here so long, **what’s your favorite part about working here?&nbsp;**

The best part for me is all the built-in friendships we have here. I get to work with my friends every day, and that’s priceless.&nbsp;

So considering everything that you do, **what would you say is the hardest part about your job every day?**

I would say it’s probably the HR functions of my job. It’s something I didn’t have a ton of experience with before my current position, so I've had to learn about it along the way.&nbsp;

I think you’ve done a great job adapting. There’s never any drama, and I appreciate that. So **what are you most excited about in the next few years?**

I’m most excited about how fast our team is growing. We’re adding a few new people to the team every week, so things are staying fresh and interesting, even though I’ve been here a long time.&nbsp;

I am just so grateful for all the help Jennakah’s been to our team. If anyone out there is interested in a career in real estate or would like to know more about Jennakah’s role on our team, give us a call at (717) 216-0860 or send an email to [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com). I’m always willing to talk.
