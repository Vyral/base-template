Large numbers of buyers have already entered the spring market to search for their dream homes. To make sure your home is ready to list, you need to do these four things.

Today I want to give you some tips on preparing your home for the spring market, which is happening right now. To ensure your home is ready, there are four things you need to do to prepare.

The first is to **figure out what your home is worth.** Homes sell much quicker when they are priced correctly from the start. Some people choose to get an independent appraisal done to figure out the best price for the market, but you can also consult an agent who will look at comparable homes with similar features to give you a good idea of what you should list at.

Second, you need to **decide when the right time to list is.** March through May is the peak time to list your home. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need to pick a specific time during peak season. It’s always prime time at the beach.

Next, you need to **maximize your curb appeal.** 63% of buyers drop by homes they’ve seen online, which means you’ll need to make a good first impression. Get rid of signs of winter by power washing, trimming bushes, putting out pine straw or mulch, and cleaning the windows.

Finally, **make sure you’re prepared for showings.** This means tidying up and decluttering, along with packing away non-essentials.

If you have any questions about pricing your house or the best time to sell, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help!
