How can you build a bona fide referral-generating machine for your real estate business? The truth is that referrals are the lifeblood of our industry, and receiving more of them starts with your database.&nbsp;

**Here are five steps you can take to turn your database into a referral generator:**

1. Put the contact information of everyone who knows, likes, and trusts you into a CRM.
2. Highlight your top 20 contacts and label them A+. Everyone else should be marked SOI, or sphere of influence.
3. Reach out to your SOI through direct mail, email, or video at least 48 times per year.&nbsp;
4. Reach out to your A+ contacts an additional three to four times a year face to face.&nbsp;
5. Make sure you’re providing your clients with value.&nbsp;

If you follow these steps, you should be able to ask them for business after you help them with a transaction. By building a foundation of trust, they’ll be more likely to give you referrals if you directly ask for them. **Be upfront; don’t be shy about asking for business.** If you’ve made genuine connections with them, they’ll be more than willing to help you.
