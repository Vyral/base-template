What’s the latest news for homebuyers in the Kuna area? &nbsp;

According to Samandra Farris of CBH Homes, Kuna is growing quickly. Their main price point ranges from $230,000 to $400,000, and **they currently have 30+ spec homes that are move-in ready, with over 70 that will be move-in ready in the next 90 days.** With a population of roughly 19,000, it’s interesting to note that Kuna residents can still qualify for a rural development loan, which is a unique option among other areas in Treasure Valley.

You should also be aware that **CBH Homes is running a year-end promotion in Kuna where they’re offering discounts on all their move-in ready homes.** Specifically, they’ll contribute $5,000 toward buyers’ closing costs or a design studio credit for homes under $250,000. For homes priced between $250,000 and $300,000, they’ll contribute $7,000. For anything above that, they’ll go all the way up to $10,000. This promotion lasts until December 16, so time is limited.

CBH homes is also hosting their third annual Festival of homes right now, which runs all throughout December and features six fully furnished sales models.
