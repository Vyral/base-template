Why do we run our business in the Twin Cities area? It’s simple: it’s an incredible place to live. If you’re considering relocating, we believe you should give the Twin Cities serious consideration, and today we’re sharing five reasons why:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp;**Minnesota is always at or near the top of best states to live in.** U.S. News and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;World Report ranked Minnesota as the second-best state in the whole country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, [www.moneyrates.com](http://www.moneyrates.com) looked at median wages, cost of living, income&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tax, unemployment rate, and workplace safety to determine their best state, and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Minnesota ranked third overall. Do a Google search if you don’t believe us;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Minnesota and the Twin Cities area are always near the top.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;**If you can handle the cold, you can experience the fullest of each season.** Our&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; springs are green, our summers are beautiful, our falls are golden, and our&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; winters are full of fun activities like skiing.

&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;**The Twin Cities are affordable.** Compared to other metro areas on the east and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;west coasts, our cost of living is shockingly low. If you want your dollar to go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;farther, you might want to consider Minnesota. We’re also home to numerous&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortune 500 companies, so there are plenty of fantastic job opportunities.

&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;**There’s so much to do in the Twin Cities\!** Besides New York City, the Twin Cities&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have more theater seats per capita than anywhere else in the U.S. On top of that,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there are plenty of culinary options for food lovers. We can’t leave out the Mall of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; America. It’s one of the greatest attractions in America for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;**The Minnesota State Fair.** It starts towards the end of August and ends around&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Labor Day. Each year, around two million people attend. If you like beer, food, or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;having a good time, you’ll love the fair.&nbsp;
