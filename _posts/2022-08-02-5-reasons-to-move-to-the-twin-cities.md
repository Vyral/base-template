Why do we run our business in the Twin Cities area? It’s simple: it’s an incredible place to live. If you’re considering relocating, we believe you should give the Twin Cities serious consideration, and today we’re sharing five reasons why:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp;**Minnesota is always at or near the top of best states to live in.** U.S. News and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;World Report ranked Minnesota as the second-best state in the whole country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, [Money Rates](www.moneyrates.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} looked at median wages, cost of living, income tax,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unemployment rate, and workplace safety to determine their best state, and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Minnesota ranked third overall. Do a Google search if you don’t believe us;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Minnesota and the Twin Cities area are always near the top.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;**You can experience the fullest of each season.** Our springs are green, our&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;summers are beautiful, our falls are golden, and our winters are full of fun&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;activities like skiing.

&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;**The Twin Cities are affordable.** Compared to other metro areas on the east and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;west coasts, our cost of living is shockingly low. If you want your dollar to go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;farther, you might want to consider Minnesota. We’re also home to numerous&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortune 500 companies, so there are plenty of fantastic job opportunities.

&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;**There’s so much to do\!** Besides New York City, the Twin Cities have more theater&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seats per capita than anywhere else in the U.S. On top of that, there are plenty of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; culinary options for food lovers. We can’t leave out the Mall of America. It’s one of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the greatest attractions in America for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;**The Minnesota State Fair.** It starts towards the end of August and ends around&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Labor Day. Each year, nearly two million people attend. If you like beer, food, or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;having a good time, you’ll love the fair.&nbsp;
