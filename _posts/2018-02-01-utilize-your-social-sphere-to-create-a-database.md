Welcome back to the second part of my series about developing relationships with your clients in your first year in the business.

Years ago when I was working insurance, before I could get my license or sell, we had to have a list of 100 of our friends and family. That practice has gone away, but it’s still important in principle.

**You need a list of everybody you know**—friends, family, and anyone you know who may refer you someone. This will be a great start to generating future leads. Contact everyone on the list at least once a month and have a conversation with them.

Ask them a simple question before hanging up, “Who do you know who is going to buy or sell a house in the next 60 to 90 days?”

These people don’t know you as a real estate agent. They know you as a farmer, a mechanic, a mother, a father, someone who coaches Little League, a teacher, a police officer, or firefighter. And they won’t see you as a real estate agent until you impress on them that you are a real estate agent.

For most people, **their friends and family won’t begin to see them as a real estate agent for two or three years** because they don’t call them regularly; they don’t impress on them their professionalism.

You can really shortcut that if you get a list of people started. You also need to use a CRM, or customer relationship management system. We use FirePoint.net, but there are a ton of them out there. The point of using a CRM is to create a system dedication to contacting your database every single month. If you do that, **it will pay dividends over the course of your career.**

If you have any questions about CRMs or about setting up or working with a database, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
