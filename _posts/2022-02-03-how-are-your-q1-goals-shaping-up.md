Are you on course with your goals? We’re about halfway through the first quarter, so it’s time to check how things are going. **If the quarter ended today, would you be hitting your target?** What changes do you need to make to ensure that you reach your objective? Do you need to revise the plan or simply execute it at a higher level?

**Remember that changing the goal is not an option.** That’s the easy way out. It’s time to take inventory and make the necessary changes to perform in the second half of the quarter.

I hope this has been helpful. If you’re looking for additional coaching or accountability, or if you just have some questions, please call, text, or email me. Make it a great day\!
