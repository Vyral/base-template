Living in a For Sale home is often a very stressful experience, but it doesn't have to be. I have a few tips to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible in this situation:

- Start packing now. The nice thing about starting the packing process soon than later is it gets rid of the clutter. One thing to remember is that clutter eats equity, so this is a crucial thing to do when selling.

- Clean up your home. Make sure everything from your baseboards to your ceiling fans are clean. If clutter eats equity, clean means green, which means more money in your pocket when you sell.

- Store valuables in a safe place. We've never had anything go missing from one of our listings, but it does happen! Make sure your valuables are in a safe place, away from anywhere a buyer might be looking.

- Get your kids involved. Getting your kids involved in the selling process will take a lot of the stress off. Have the kids help you get the home ready for showtime!

If you're living in your home while it's on the market, these things should make a huge difference! If you need real estate assistance, or if you have any questions for us, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
