<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’re hosting a free pie giveaway, and you’re invited!</em></p>

Happy November\! **It’s almost Thanksgiving time.** I think November is a great month because, coming from India, never before have I experienced a holiday that is just about saying thanks for all we have and thank you to the people who come into our lives in a positive way. So, this month is my time to say thank you to all my clients, past, present, and future.&nbsp;

Without you, how can I do what I do? My calling is saving animals, and I rescue special needs and hospice dogs, which means our vet bills are huge. I wouldn’t be able to save dogs if you hadn’t chosen to work with me, so thank you again. I don’t just want to say thank you, I want to do something for you.

So, **we are hosting a free pie giveaway** for all our clients. You should have received our email by now, but if you haven’t, [click here](http://ohmypickyourpie.com){: target="_blank"} and let us know what kind of pie you would like. On November 25 and 26 we will be waiting for you at our office with your pie so we can reconnect and say hello. We’ll have refreshments, cake, and cookies, so hang out with us for a little while.&nbsp;

Thank you for your business and your trust. Happy Thanksgiving\!&nbsp;

If you ever have any questions about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to help you\!
