Amie Sharpe joins us today to talk more about the loan process.

In our previous video, we talked to Crystal about the beginning of mortgage application process. This time, we’re talking with Amie about the closing part of the process.

As a loan partner, Amie has worked with us for almost two years and has worked in the mortgage industry for five years. Prior to joining us, she worked with a law firm negotiating short sales. **Her role in the loan process is to collect documents from borrowers and make the process as painless as possible for them from beginning to end.**

When it comes to her job, what she enjoys most is that not every day is the same. “It’s always different,” she says. “It’s fast-paced and it keeps me focused.” She also enjoys the different people she gets to work with every day and helping them achieve their goal of owning a home.

“We’re kind of like a family here. We all work together. We have a pretty good flow of how things go, from the pre-approval process to the closing process.”

If there’s one thing she would like you to know about the mortgage process, it’s the volume of documents they have to collect. After the TRID guidelines took effect, they’ve had to collect more documents and ask more questions. Not because they want to pry into people’s personal lives, but because it’s for their own protection.

If you have any questions or are thinking about purchasing a home and starting the pre-approval process, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you.
