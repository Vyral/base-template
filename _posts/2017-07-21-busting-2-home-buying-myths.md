Home buying isn’t as scary or expensive as you probably think. Here’s what we mean.

<div class="post-cta">

In a recent Realtor.com survey, 46% of prospective homebuyers didn’t think they would qualify for a mortgage, so they didn’t even bother applying. There are two common myths behind this way of thinking, and we’re going to bust both of them today.

**1. You need 20% for a down payment.** That’s not true at all. In today’s market, you can get a loan for 5%, 3%, or even 0% down. We can find a program that works for you.

**2. You need a credit score of 780.** This is another complete falsehood. In the same survey mentioned above, 53.2% of homebuyers had a credit score between 600 and 750. That gives you a pretty good idea right there.

Hopefully, this debunks those myths for you if you were under the impression that they were true.

If you have any other questions about buying a home or need any other help, feel free to give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
