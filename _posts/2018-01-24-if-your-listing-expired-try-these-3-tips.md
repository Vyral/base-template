So your home expired from the market—what do you do next?

There are three specific things you can do to get your home sold this year:

1. **Take a look at your price.**When you listed your home last time, did you really take a close look at what else was selling in the area and your current competition? Here’s the thing: We take a close look at what homes like yours are selling for and we make sure that you’re getting the most money possible.
2. **What objections did buyers have with your previous listing?** Were there things that you could get rid of in your house in terms of, say, decluttering? Were there some upgrades you could have made? Consider hiring a professional stager to come through to fluff the pillows and add some decorative items to really make your house stand out.
3. **Did you have the right agent?** Oftentimes a house goes stale because it’s been on the market for too long. What you want to do is take new pictures, get fresh ideas, and hit the market like a brand-new listing.
