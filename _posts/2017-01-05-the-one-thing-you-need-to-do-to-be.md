The one thing you need to do to be a successful real estate agent is to make sure that you get an education, and I’m not talking about studying for your licensing exam.

One of the keys to success in our business is education.

If I can name one thing that a real estate agent should do, it’s to **make sure that you get an education.**

I’m not talking about getting your real estate license. When you get a real estate license, you take a course, you take a test, and then you forget all about it.

I’m talking about learning how to sell. I don’t mean selling real estate. No one in real estate sells houses. You need to learn how to sell your own skills and expertise. Nobody on my team has sold a house to a client because the client picks the house.

We sell what we do for the client. We sell how we can do that better than anyone else.

Selling is helping people realize that where they think they want to be might not be where they actually want to be. Selling is about overcoming self-imposed objections.

If you’re going to be a professional agent, you need to learn your craft. This is not something to be taken lightly. This is not a hobby. **Anyone who wants to be the best should learn from the best.**

Thankfully, we have a group of mentors here who have helped us, taught us, and brought us along on the journey. If you want to learn how to sell houses at a very high level, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
