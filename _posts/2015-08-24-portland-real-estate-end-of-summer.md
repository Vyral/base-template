Portland's market is still going strong as we wrap up the summer season. Today, we take a quick look at what current conditions mean for you and the future of our market.

Right now, it's still very common to see multiple offers on any given properties. In fact, some buyers are even willing to waive appraisals and look for ways to leverage themselves against the buyers they are competing with. It's very competitive these days, and it can be difficult to get into a home unless you get creative.

When multiple offers are as common as they are now, I like to look at the S&P/Case-Schiller Home Price Indices. This is a national report that we get every month and the one we got at the end of July showed that, nationally, single-family homes were at a 4-5% appreciation rate. That's a much better rate than we saw in 2013. Over the next two years, we're expecting home prices to slow a bit, as they've been rising rapidly over the last few years.

 Portland has seen an appreciation level of about 7.4% over the last year or so. Because home prices keep rising, many people in our area have asked if this is a bubble. Frankly, I don't think so; there's a difference between the makeup of the buyer today and the buyer leading up to the crash. Back then, you didn't need much of a down payment or any at all, and generally people weren't as qualified. Today, the buyers are highly qualified and ready to go!

If you have any questions about where our market is heading, don't hesitate to give me a call or shoot me and email. I would love to hear from you!
