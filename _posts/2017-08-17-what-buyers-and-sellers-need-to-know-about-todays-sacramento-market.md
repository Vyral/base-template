If you’ve been looking to buy or sell in today’s real estate market, there is some important information you’ll need to know before moving forward. Today, I’m bringing you a market update.

Right now, sales have dropped dramatically. This isn’t because people aren’t buying—it’s because, currently, **the supply is far too low for the high demand in our area.**

There simply isn’t enough for people to choose from.

However, this is a great opportunity for sellers. Competition is low from a selling perspective.

So, listing your home right now could mean getting more bang for your buck. This is a strong seller’s market, so you should absolutely take advantage if you’ve been thinking of doing so.

However, there’s still some great news for buyers in today’s market.

**Interest rates are very low—they’ve been hovering around 4% since the beginning of 2017.**

Despite this being a seller’s market, buyers have a lot of opportunities to take advantage of in our market today, as well.

If you have been thinking of buying or selling, now is a great time to do so. Today’s market has a lot to offer for buyers and sellers alike.

However, do consider your personal situation before making any move. Questions about your individual circumstances should all be taken care of with the help of your local real estate professionals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
