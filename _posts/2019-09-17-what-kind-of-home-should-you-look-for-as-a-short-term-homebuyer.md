If you’re a buyer who is moving to our area in Charleston for a set period of time, maybe a few years, what’s the best short-term home purchase you can make? We’re going to explore that today.

If you’re buying a home that you know you’ll only have for two to three years, **you need to consult our “buyer funnel” which is pictured at 1:10 in the video above.** For a short-term buyer, you’re going to want to zero in on a home that appeals to the most buyers possible.

**The No. 1 resale factor is a one-story home.** The least desirable resale factor is a split-level home.

**Another thing to look at is the price of the home.** Homes that are less expensive, or the least expensive in a particular neighborhood, are going to appeal to the most number of buyers as well. The most expensive home certainly won’t.

The next thing we’re going to look at is upgrades. **Most buyers will want a completely upgraded home,** while the fewest number of buyers want homes with only a few upgrades.&nbsp;

Finally, homes that are new construction or newer always tend to resell better. Older homes are appealing to some, especially here in Charleston, but they’re not as appealing to short-term buyers.

**If you want to make your home re-sale proof, you want to buy something that is one-story, inexpensive, completely upgraded, and new.** That will get you the most buyers when it comes time to sell.

If you have any other questions for me about buying a short-term home or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
