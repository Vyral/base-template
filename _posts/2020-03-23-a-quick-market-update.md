<br>**For those wondering how our real estate market is performing, here’s a quick update (<u><a target="_blank" href="https://pdfhost.io/v/5oYknq~zU_Carolina_Forest.pdf">view the full report here</a></u>):&nbsp;**

* In February 2020, there were more listings and sales in the Carolina Forest area of Myrtle Beach than in 2019
* As you’d expect, the coronavirus has been a recent curveball; there are still buyers looking for properties, and we are still helping them with this immediate need
* We’re limited our in-person meetings and implementing more video showings
* There are fewer buyers in town right now, as some people have postponed trips
* We’re still listing properties and putting others under contract; it’s business as usual—just done more cautiously
