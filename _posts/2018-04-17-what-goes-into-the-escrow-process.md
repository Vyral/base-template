Today, I’ll be discussing the escrow process and some of the key things you need to know when going into it.

Perhaps the most important fact to bear in mind is that in every transaction, whether it’s the purchase of a new home or the sale of your current one, there are over 54 people involved. This makes effective communication absolutely essential from the very beginning.

Effective communication starts with the power of the introduction, which isn’t quite as simple as it sounds. When we open, not only am I introducing my role in the transaction, I’m also providing any contact information or executed contracts, making sure that they’re properly distributed and that all parties are on the same page.

Because of that, it requires strict organization to make sure you have access to all of that information at a moment’s notice. That also brings into play the idea of contingencies.

What is a contingency, and how does that apply to the escrow process?

Simply put, **a contingency is a contractual deadline by which a certain activity must be completed.** There are a number of different aspects of the escrow process that fall under this:

1. **Inspections.** Inspections abide by really strict deadlines; not only do you have to schedule the inspection while working around everyone’s schedules, ensuring that access to the property is provided, and also securing the method of payment, you also have to make sure that by the end of that deadline, all reports and any required repairs have been distributed. It’s key to make sure that happens.<br>&nbsp;
2. **Appraisal.** The appraisal process not only requires that organization and communication, but also requires a little bit of knowledge of the process. An appraisal won’t be ordered until all upfront disclosures have been signed with the lending party. Once that happens, it’s crucial to know if the appraiser has reached out to the listing side to make sure the appraisal has been scheduled and that access to the property will be provided.<br>&nbsp;
3. **Repairs.** If the appraiser called out any required repairs on the report, they must be completed by the close of escrow. If they aren’t, you cannot close the transaction. This is also another area where communication and organization are key, since you’ll have to make sure that all documentation has been distributed so as to show everyone that the repairs have been made.<br>&nbsp;
4. **Close of escrow.** This part tends to be the most hectic because everything has to fall into line perfectly. For example, if you’re dealing with a loan, you have to make sure that not only has loan approval been secured, but that loan documents have been sent over to the title company. At this point the signing appointment can be scheduled. This will also involve working around everyone’s schedule and making sure it occurs in a timely fashion. Once that happens, the final step is making sure that the title transfer recorded with the county.
