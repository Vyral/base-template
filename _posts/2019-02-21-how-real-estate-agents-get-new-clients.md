When working in real estate, you need a way to find clients. Here’s how to do it.

In continuing our series about the career of real estate, today we’d like to share how agents find new clients.

People assume that when they get into real estate, they’ll simply be showing homes all day. **However, the reality is that agents spend a majority of their time marketing and generating business so they can form and build trusting relationships.** That way, they can serve clients and help them become homeowners or get their homes sold.

There are many different sources that can be used to find these new relationships. After my 16 years in real estate, I’ve learned the best way to get clients is through our existing relationships—our sphere of influence. These are people who know, like, and trust us and vice versa. Here’s an easy litmus test: **If you’d say hello to them in a grocery store, they’re probably in your sphere of influence.**

You want to make a list of people you know, like, and trust, and reach out to them to let them know you’re in real estate. If they’re going to move, they want to work with someone they trust. And if they already trust you, you’re off to a good start.

You want to market to these people. The best form of marketing is through educational content—teaching people about the industry (like in this video) is an example. It helps engage them, answer their questions, and establish you as a credible resource. **It also helps solidify and expand their trust in you.**

If you do these things consistently, people will keep you in mind when their real estate needs arise. There are many other ways to find clients, such as cold-calling and door-knocking. You can also advertise on the radio, TV, and social media. Strategies exist across the board, but the main thing to keep in mind is that you, as a Realtor, own a small business. You’re responsible for generating the relationships, clients, and business you deal with. **It’s very rarely handed to you.**

If you’re interested in getting started in real estate, **we host a meet-and-greet event each month where we go deeper into what the career may mean for you.** It’s a great way to learn more and see if you want to take the next step with our team or with real estate in general.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions, need more information, or would like to attend our next event. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
