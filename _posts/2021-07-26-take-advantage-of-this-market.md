There are three reasons why sellers should list their homes right now:

**1\. Low inventory.** Our home inventory is at an all-time low right now. If you have a house to sell, now is the time to put it on the market. Don’t miss this opportunity.

**2\. Higher prices for our sellers.** Because of the low inventory,&nbsp; home sellers are getting more for their homes.

**3\. More equity in your pocket.** Higher sales prices are&nbsp; giving sellers more equity to use elsewhere.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to help in any way that I can.
