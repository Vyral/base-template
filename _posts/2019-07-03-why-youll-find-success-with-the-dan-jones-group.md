<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What makes The Dan Jones Group different from other brokerages? Find out today.</em></p>

The Dan Jones Group sets itself apart from other brokerages in a number of ways, so today I’d like to highlight a few of our distinguishing qualities.

People often ask members of our team about how much money they make, or what our splits are. **One of our listing agents has already made $130,000 GCI this year—and that’s the bottom line, not the top line, and the year isn’t even half over\!** Another agent of ours is working through her first full year on the team, and she’s already taken home $78,000 so far, and is set to close out her first year having made $150,000 or more.

What allows our agents to have this level of success?

Well, we have structure. Many big-box brokerages want their new agents to come in, pay their desk dues, and get to work. **Our team doesn’t have desk dues**—we’re not interested in having hundreds of people joining our firm so that we can collect dues from them; instead, we’re looking for just one or two agents who want to sell 35 to 40 homes in their first year with us. With a team of talented co-workers, **our agents have the time and means to foster a personal life, complete with vacation and personal time.**

To maintain our structured work environment, **we emphasize accountability.** We have three coaches in our organization who have all sold at really high levels and who will hold you accountable to your goals and dollar-producing activities on a daily basis. You don’t get that when you work with a group of 400 people in the office alongside you. We also hold our agents accountable for the long-term, as well. Helping people improve is a core value of our team-growth mindset.

If you’ve ever considered joining a high-producing team of real estate professionals, just know that, unlike some team leaders in our area, I’m personally out of production, meaning **all the leads and business that I find goes out to my team.**

If you have any questions or would like to speak to me about joining The Dan Jones Group, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
