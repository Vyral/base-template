We can’t be successful without a purpose, and our biggest purpose is in giving back to our community.

My partners and I started our brokerage in 2003, and it’s been growing ever since. Three years ago, my wife and I started our own team inside the brokerage and experienced even further growth. In the last year, we sold over $30 million in real estate through 148 transactions, and I was able to leave production altogether.

**Though I had reached every goal possible, I still felt like it didn’t matter.** I didn’t have a purpose I was shooting for, and it made me feel empty. Though I loved growing my business, it simply didn’t have a deeper purpose for me.&nbsp;

This feeling came to a head after my wife and I visited Haiti. On the way back home, my thoughts kept returning to a Haitian girl I met named Lovely. **In her daily life, she never knew when her next meal would be.** Sitting on the plane, I realized how much I wanted to help people in need.

**I knew I had to strive for something deeper in our business and in our community.** We began taking a percentage of each commission check and setting it into a separate account. We asked our clients about causes that needed help, and we found that we could deliver a rapid response to urgent situations.

Our entire staff has been incredible, meeting with people in need and making anonymous donations. We’ve been able to make a huge impact on our community, and our business success ensures we’re able to continue making a difference each day.

I can’t imagine what things would be like if we hadn’t taken these steps, and I can’t believe I used to simply deal with selling homes. **We’ve been given a purpose and a reason to feel good about coming into work each day.** We’ve been given a reason to take on even more business and do an even better job for our clients. Even when we’re having a tough time, we know we’re doing something important. We’re investing in our community.

By choosing our team, you’re not only choosing great service, but also choosing to help the community as a whole. If you would like to learn more about what we can do for you, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
