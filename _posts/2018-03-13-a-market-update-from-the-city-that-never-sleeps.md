We recently got a chance to fly out to Las Vegas to attend Re/MAX’s Annual R4 Convention, and we got some great footage to share with you.

First though, let’s take a look at our market back in Louisville and check the absorption rate for our home supply. In the $100,000 to $350,000 price range, we have a one-to-three-month supply.

**If you’re looking to sell this spring, there are five good reasons you should do so:**

Demand is strong.

There is less competition now than you’ll find in a few months.

The closing process will be quicker.

There will never be a better time to move up into a bigger house than right now.

It’s time to move on with your life—why wait?

Nationally, buyer demand continues to outpace inventory of homes for sale, even in Louisville and Southern Indiana. Mortgage rates continue to climb, which might be a problem for buyers in a couple of years, but right now they’re still hovering at a very acceptable rate. Remember—the higher the interest rates, the lower your purchasing power. Take a look at the video above at the 1:31 mark to see exactly what happens to a buyer’s purchasing power when their interest rate jumps from 3.75% to 5.25%.

**That brings us to our next point—the four reasons why you should buy a home this spring:**

Prices will continue to rise.

Mortgage interest rates are projected to increase at least one or two more times in 2018.

Whether you’re buying or renting, you’re still paying for a mortgage—why not put your money into a home savings account?

Again, it’s time to move on with your life.

Also, you should be thankful you don’t have to pay your mom and dad’s interest rates. Back in the 1970s, interest rates were as high as 18%. Compared to now, where they’re hovering between 4.25% and 4.5%, that’s pretty good.

Now, back to our Las Vegas trip. We’ve come to the Re/MAX R4 Convention to find products to make our lives and yours easier. There’s a lot of new technology and revised technology to look at, and we’re always looking to learn the very latest to help our buyers and sellers. Being here also means we have the chance to attend masterminds and other Re/MAX conventions, and on this trip, I got the chance to speak one-on-one with the incoming head of Re/MAX, Adam Contos. You can see a clip of our conversation at the 3:18 mark in the video.

Of course, we also got a chance to do a little sightseeing and take a trip out to Red Rock Canyon to test out one of our new drones. What’s special about this drone is it responds to hand motions, which means you can control its movements without touching the controls. As difficult as it was to film the rocks with our drone, **imagine how easy it will be to shoot homes back in Louisville.**

We had a blast in Las Vegas, but we’re happy to be heading back home, so if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to help you.
