*Here’s how we’ve been ahead of the tech curve in the mortgage industry.*

Like pretty much every industry in this country, the mortgage industry has changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. What will a post-pandemic mortgage industry look like?

**The first big change is that people aren’t able to walk into a bank or lender's office and ask for a loan or refinance anymore.** You need to make an appointment first. The good thing about our team is that we’ve always been a tech-based brokerage ahead of the digital curve. We’ve been having clients schedule their appointments online for years, so we are specialists in remotely lending. Everything we do is web-based; nothing needs to be printed, and we can communicate directly on the computer.

What happens when you have to sign documents? **As long as they’re not the final documents that need a notary, everything can be signed electronically.** That makes the process not only safer, but also more convenient.&nbsp;

Throughout the process, basically everything gets done electronically. There’s no need for you to always work with a local lender because that in-person interaction isn’t necessary. However, **if you are like me and like talking to a person and being able to look them in the eye, we can hold Zoom meetings** where we will break everything down and share our screen to go over the documents one by one.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that lending has never been better, more convenient, or more user-friendly.** If you have any mortgage-related questions for me or needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
