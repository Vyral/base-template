Yesterday I reached out to a property owner who had listed theirs as “For Sale By Owner” (FSBO). After introducing myself, the owner cut me off and asked what good it would do for them to use an agent to sell their house.

It is not the first time I have been asked this question, so I thought I would give you **a list of some of the people you will encounter while selling your home:**

1. **The buyer’s agent.** This agent solely represents the interests of the buyer. As a seller, you will need a professional in your own corner to represent your best interest.
2. **The buyer’s attorney or title company.** In most cases, you have to make sure they have the documents needed to close a transaction on time.
3. **Home inspection companies.** These work for the buyer and will almost always find some problems with the house.
4. **The buyer’s lender.** You will need to check whether or not the buyer’s finances are credible if they are using financing to purchase your home.
5. **An appraiser.**

Real estate agents like me are trained and experienced in negotiation, and, in most cases, sellers aren’t. Sellers must realize that their ability to negotiate will determine whether or not they get the best deal for themselves and their families.
