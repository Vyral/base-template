Today we're going to discuss new developments and new construction in the Des Moines area.

**Compared to 2014, 2015 has certainly seen a rise in new construction.** We have huge gains in new builds, and there are many new developments coming online as well. Those developments are going up primarily on the west side of town.

**When considering new construction, it's very important to have a real estate agent who is well-versed in the industry.** There are so many things that go into building; thousands of parts go into a new home. From lots and developments to different builders and the home itself, it's important to have an adviser who protects your interests.

There are a lot of major components to consider when you build a new home: Which builders suit your needs? What price point are you looking for? Where do you want to live? Which development is best for you? **We want to make sure that your home is going to fit into your new neighborhood.**

**Financing is also a huge consideration.** There are products you can get that lock in your rate when you start the home building process. That way, you know what your payments will be, and you know what the interest rate will be.

If you have any questions about today's topic, or about real estate in general, please give me a call or shoot me an email. We'd love to hear from you!
