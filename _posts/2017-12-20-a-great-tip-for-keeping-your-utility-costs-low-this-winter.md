How can you stay warm and keep your utility costs lower this winter? We have a great tip for you.

**Changing your thermostats to a digital and programmable type will make a huge difference in your monthly bill.** The thermostats we installed several years ago cost about $68 at Lowe’s. The brand is Lux, and the model number is TX9600. It’s a seven-day, universal touch-screen thermostat. Our utility bills were reduced by $100 a month.
