We’re at the end of the year and you may be thinking, “I want to buy a home and I want to sell my home. Should I make my move now or should I just wait until next year?” Today I want to talk to you about timing the market and seasonality.&nbsp;

There are many reasons why it may be a great time to act now. Many people take their homes off the market, so **there’s significantly less competition** during the holiday season. It’s a great time for your house to stand out.

On the buyer side, if you're serious about moving over the holidays, you’ll find that the **people in the market are also serious** about selling. During the holidays, you're more likely to find motivated people on both sides of the transaction that are excited to work together, and make a win-win deal.&nbsp;

Generally, you want to act sooner than later because we can't predict what'll happen with rates, prices, or anything else. The market today is the one that we know now. We don't know what's going to happen in the future.&nbsp;

Come up with a plan that makes the most sense for you, but don't write off this time of year. There's plenty of opportunity, and we make it a point to look for those opportunities.&nbsp; If you have any questions, contact us by phone or email. We're here to help.
