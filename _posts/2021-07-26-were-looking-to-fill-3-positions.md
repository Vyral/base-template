We have a few positions on our team that we’d like to fill. If you’ve ever wanted to get into the real estate business or already are but want something different, **this is an excellent opportunity.** We are the No. 1 team in the state, we’ve sold over 600 homes, we’re the No. 2 team in Keller Williams in the Northwest Region, and out of the 180,000 real estate agents with Keller Williams in the U.S., the Walden Team is No. 14.&nbsp;

Now is a fantastic time to advance your career, and we currently have three positions open. **We need a listing partner, and this person needs their real estate license and experience.** We’re also looking for people to fill two buyer agent positions; our preference is that you have your real estate license and experience, but it’s not required. Hiring for those positions will depend more on us sitting down and discussing you and the job.&nbsp;

If you might be interested in one of these positions, give us a call or send an email. If you know of anyone who may be interested, please pass this message along to them. We look forward to hearing from some wonderful candidates.
