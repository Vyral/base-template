<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a quick tip for homebuyers regarding the information presented in a listing.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Recently, one of our buyers was purchasing a home in a community where the school district was listed incorrectly for every single listing in that area.&nbsp;**If there is a particular feature of a home that is important to you, be it that home’s school district, if it has a septic tank or maybe square-footage, share that with your agent so they can double-check primary sources to make sure the listing’s information is accurate**. You don’t want to find out later in the process that something you were depending on turned out to be wrong.

If you ever have any questions about buying a home or would like us to check if a listing’s information is correct, just reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
