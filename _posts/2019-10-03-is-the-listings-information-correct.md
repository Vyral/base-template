<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a quick tip for homebuyers regarding the information presented in a listing.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Recently, one of our buyers was purchasing a home in a community where the school district was listed incorrectly for every single listing in that area. If there’s a particular feature of a home that you’re looking for, be it that home’s school district or its septic tank square-footage, **share that with your agent so they can double-check primary sources to make sure the listing’s information is accurate**. You don’t want to find out later in the process that something you were depending on turned out to be wrong, like our buyer\!

If you ever have any questions about buying a home or would like us to check if a listing’s information is correct, just reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
