Today I want to give you a quick reminder that 2019 is a tax reassessment year in Horry County. This means **if your property has increased in value by $1,000 or more, you should receive a reassessment notice this month**. It’s also a good time to check and see how you’re being taxed. If you’re not being taxed as a primary homeowner, you’re paying 2.5 times more in taxes each year. If you’re living in your house full-time, **make sure you’re not being overcharged**. If you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
