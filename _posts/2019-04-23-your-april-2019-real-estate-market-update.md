Before we begin today’s market update, mark your calendar\! Our annual client appreciation event is coming up on August 21, and you’re invited. At this event, we’ll also be fundraising for the Burned Children’s Fund at MUSC.&nbsp;

**Now, onto the latest news in our market.** 2019 looks like it will be an excellent year, but not quite as good as 2017 and 2018. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—stabilization in the market gives us long-term consistent growth instead of massive ups and downs.

We may not sell as many homes this year as we did in the recent past, but appreciation is at about 4.8% on average.&nbsp;

**Depending on who you’re listening to, you’ll hear all kinds of different stories about our 2019 market.** Be careful with what you believe; some Realtors are doing poorly, so they’ve chosen to project that the market is also poor.&nbsp;

For our team, homes only spend about 11 days on the market before they’re under contract. In our market, homes takes about 61 days to sell on average, so we’re selling them six times faster. We’ve also kept a 100% sale-to-list price ratio, meaning sellers have gotten all of their asking price without having to accept less.

**Most brokerages out there haven’t grown at all this year, but we’ve grown by over 40%.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
