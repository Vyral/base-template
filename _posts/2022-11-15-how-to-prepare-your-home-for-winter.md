Today we’re here to talk about what you need to do to prepare for winter. Yes, it is that time again. It seemed like summer was so short this year\! However, we would make sure you have your snow shovels ready because you're going to need them. To fully get ready for winter, there are a few things you need to do in your home.&nbsp;

**First, ensure your gutters are clean and your leaf guards are on to avoid future water build-up.** Also, make sure your downspouts are attached properly. When they’re not, the water drains right into the foundation, and that's the last thing you want.

Next, I suggest putting caulk around your windows and doors to avoid energy loss and cold air coming through. If you have older windows, you can always buy saran wrap to help. It might not be ideal, but it will help you get through the winter.

In addition, make sure you have your heater and its filters serviced and cleaned. Most people don't realize that **gas-forced air furnaces need to be serviced once a year**. Doing that will double its life.&nbsp;

If you have an authentic wood fireplace, ensure your chimneys are clean to prevent any potential of a house fire. Take your water hoses off the faucets, put covers on them, and make sure you have insulation on your pipes. In addition, seal your attic. Put caulk around it, and if you need to get in there for any reason, you just can cut it back open.&nbsp;

Go into your crawl spaces and check your sump pumps if you have them. If you don't have programmable thermostats, go get them, because they will save you a lot of money. If you have them, make sure you change the batteries, which brings me to my last point: check the batteries in your smoke and CO detectors. **Make sure that everything's working because we tend to hunker down and close off all the circulation in our homes in the winter.**
