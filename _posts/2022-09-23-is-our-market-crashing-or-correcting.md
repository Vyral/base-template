Today we're going to talk about how the game has changed. We don't have a crystal ball, but there are a lot of viral things that are kind of fear mongering. We’re not saying they don't have some information that's relevant, but many of them just want to stoke fear. For example, have you heard that the market is going to crash?

Let's look at that claim, at least for our market. Buyers bought homes at 2% and 3% interest rates, and for the most part, most of these people came in with a lot of money, at least 5% down, but mostly 20% and more because they were paying over appraised value. **Why would that person move, and why would that person foreclose?**

Furthermore, banks now are really helping people in distress by extending their loan amount to 40 years. So when you see these TikTok videos from amateur real estate agents who really don't have a lot to back their claims up with, I feel like it's fear mongering. They’ll say, “Sell now, sell now\!” However, you have to know when it's right for you to sell.

If you're confused about it, ask for a consultation, not just from us. We would love to sit and talk to you, but talk to your financial advisor and CPA too. Look at where you stand, how long you think you're going to be in this area, and what your retirement looks like. You can't just follow a TikTok video.

**We don’t just come at you guys with our feelings; we actually show the facts.** We're looking at the data, and we know that builders can't build fast enough. The lumber prices and material costs have gone up so much that they can't just build.

The second part is we actually have a shortage of homes. We don't have enough for the millennials that are now starting to buy. That's putting some upward pressure on housing. We don't predict a big crash like what we had in 2008 because lending practices are very different. They just weren't giving loans out like free candy.&nbsp;

We listen to seven different economists so you don't have to. We're prepared so you don’t have to be. If you want to talk about our market or your specific situation, please call or email us. We are always willing to help\!
