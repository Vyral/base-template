*“I met John through becoming one of his vendors. I would do all of his closing gifts for the clients that he sold homes to. After seeing how successful he was with all of his clients I decided I wanted him to sell my house. I noticed a lot of the things he was doing for his clients through his Facebook page, that was impressive to me. I just wanted to make sure to use a realtor that was using a lot of different resources to sell my house, not just throwing it up on something and hoping it would sell. He seemed to market his homes a lot and that’s why I chose him.*

*We had a pretty interesting situation with our mortgage lender and his team just helped stay on top of that. They made phone calls and pushed people to do their jobs and get it done quickly.”*<br><br>**-Melissa Lockwood, Home Seller**
