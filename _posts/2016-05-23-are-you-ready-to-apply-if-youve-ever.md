If you’ve ever applied for a mortgage, you know how much documentation is needed. If not, **it’s important to know exactly what you’ll need to keep the process going smoothly.**

 Your type of income determines the documentation you’ll need to provide in most cases.

 If you’re a W-2 employee (taxes are taken out of your paycheck) will need two years of W-2 forms, and if you rental property or commissionable income, or your bonus exceeds 25% of your salary, you’ll need two years of income tax returns.

 **You also need 30 days worth of recent paycheck stubs, two months worth of account statements for check, savings, retirement; anywhere that your money comes from.** You also need to provide 24 months of employment residence history, along with identity verification like a driver’s license, social security card, or passport.

 For those who are self-employed or a contractor (taxes aren’t taken out of your paycheck) you’ll need two years worth of 1099 and K-1 forms, two years of full personal tax returns, and **if you own more than 25% of the business, you’ll need two years of the business tax returns as well.**

 Everyone will also need to provide a year-to-date profit-loss, to show that your income is in line with the tax returns from an income and expense standpoint. We’ll help you with that.
