Here are six steps you need to take to have a smooth home sale once you have an accepted offer:

**1. Proper preparation.** Before you have an accepted offer, you’ll receive a transfer disclosure statement and a seller property questionnaire. These documents will ask you about your property, what’s wrong with it that you know of, what upgrades you’ve made, and what repairs you’ve done. It’s important to fill those out completely and get them back to your Realtor. You might find a few problems in your home that you weren’t aware of, so this is a good time to fix those and make sure the home is completely ready for the buyer.

**2. Make sure you get your sewer clearance done.** This is a test of your sewer line from the house to the street and the county and town mandate that this is completed before you close escrow. This will cost anywhere from $300 to $1,500. You don’t want to push this process off because it could delay your closing. Make sure to get it done before we enter escrow.

**3. Before the inspection, unlock all of your doors, closets and any areas under the house.**

**4. Make sure your electricity, heat, and water are on and have smoke detectors as well as CO2 detectors on each floor.**

**5. Be reasonable with buyers’ repair requests.** The inspectors are very detail-oriented and find things on the report that you don’t even notice. Work with the buyers by either getting the safety hazards fixed or giving them credit on the sale price of the home.

**6. Be flexible and stay calm during closing.** Right now, it’s common for lenders to delay closings, which is completely out of the buyers’ hands. Allow them a few extra days to get all of their finances in order. The chances of them walking when their deposit is in jeopardy are very low. Oftentimes, after a one- or two-week delay, we’ll ask the buyer to pay a little bit for a delay which might put some more pressure on the lender to get things done.

I hope these tips help you have a smooth home sale, escrow, and closing process. If you have any questions in the meantime or if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
