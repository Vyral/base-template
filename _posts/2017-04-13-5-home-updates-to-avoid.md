If you want to make some improvements in your home to increase its value and get a great return on your investment, you have a lot of options. However, there are five renovations should absolutely avoid:

**1. Wallpaper:** Unless you're in a high-end custom home and hired designers who specifically recommended wallpaper, it's generally not the best choice. When you sell your house, you want it to appeal to as many buyers as possible, and wallpaper is a little too specific for today's buyers.

**2. Flooring:** Most homes have carpet in high-traffic areas that needs to be replaced. However, today's buyers don't want you to replace it with more carpet! You've got some really great options to use over carpet, like inexpensive tile, laminate flooring, and hardwood flooring that's about the same cost as replacing carpet. We can help you find the flooring that will not only make your home appeal to more buyers, but give you the best return possible.

**3. Lavish lighting:** There are some beautiful and trendy lighting fixtures available, but buyers don't see a lot of value in these pieces. Although you may love them, they won't bring you a dollar-for-dollar return on your money. Instead, go with some clean and simple fixtures that will actually get you a return on your money.

**4. Paint:** If you want to paint inside or even just do some touch-ups, you want to stick with neutral colors. Dark accent walls and bright colors don't appeal to the masses, and you want to appeal to as many buyers as possible to get lots of offers on your house when you sell it. Neutral colors also make your home feel more bright inside and more spacious.

**5. Pools:** If you're thinking about selling your house, this probably isn't something you're considering. However, if you plan on staying in your home long-term and you're looking for upgrades that will give you the best return on your money, a pool isn't the best option. Unfortunately, you typically won't get the money you invest in it back when you sell the house. Appraisers don't give a lot of credit for them and buyers don't usually realize how expensive they are, so they don't give much value to them when writing an offer on a home.

If you'd like to know which upgrades or renovations will add the most value to your specific home or you have any questions about the market in the Simi Valley, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to help you out!
