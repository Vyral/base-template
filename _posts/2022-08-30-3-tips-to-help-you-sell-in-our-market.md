What’s going on in our market? Houses are still selling but not as fast as they did a few months ago. Sellers aren’t getting 40 offers on their property, and we don’t see that happening again any time soon.&nbsp;

The average days on market in Tracy is 44 days. We have way more inventory than we used to, which simply affects the time your home spends on the market. Despite this, there are still a few things you can do to help your home sell faster:

**1\. Price your home aggressively.** Overpricing your home is not a good idea in right now. Buyers will overlook your house, and it will sit on the market. Eventually, you’ll have to drop the price anyway.

**2\. Your house has to look good.** We can’t just throw it on the market. The photos have to look nice, the home needs to be staged, and everything needs to feel spacious and bright.

**3\. Marketing is critical.** The days of tossing a sign in the yard are gone. You need an aggressive agent who will spend a lot of money on marketing like we do.&nbsp;

Patience is key right now. Give the process some time and follow the rules. We’ve gone from an extreme seller’s market to a more normal one, which means we’re returning to the basics. Make sure you don’t have a knee-jerk reaction if an offer comes in low. Take the night to think it over and remember that it’s not personal. Everyone is just trying to figure out this market.

If you have any questions, feel free to call or email us. We would love to help guide you through the selling process.
