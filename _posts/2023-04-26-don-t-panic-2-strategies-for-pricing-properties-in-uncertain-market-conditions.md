By now, you’ve probably noticed that our housing market is shifting. Prices and interest rates are fluctuating, so how can you find the right price for your clients’ properties?

When the cost of borrowing money increases rapidly, buyers and sellers become uncertain about how to price their properties or make offers on them. As real estate agents, it's our job to advise and educate them on this process, especially when comparable sales data is hard to find. To help you with this, I’m sharing two tips that will let you confidently price properties in a shifting market.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

**First, don't just rely on sold properties.** Look at actively listed properties to see what your clients are competing with. This gives you a real-time look at the market environment and helps you price properties accordingly.

**Second, be cautious about making definitive statements on pricing.** Instead of giving a single price, offer a range based on comparable sales and active listings. Then, help your clients understand the pros and cons of different pricing strategies and let them make the final decision based on their motivation and goals.
