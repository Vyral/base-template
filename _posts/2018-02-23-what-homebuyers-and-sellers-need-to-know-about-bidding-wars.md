In our last video, we mentioned that the average list-to-sales price ratio is just over 100%. That means a lot of people are ending up in multiple offer situations and bidding wars.

**For buyers, especially first-time buyers, it’s important that you know what to expect and how to best position yourself to win in a multiple offer situation.** There are a number of factors to consider, such as your asking price, your contingencies (like inspections and appraisals), and even something as small as including a personal letter to a seller. Work with a knowledgeable, professional agent like me to guide you to the right strategy.

As a seller, it’s very important to understand what’s going on in the market and position your property perfectly for this situation. If you price your home too high and the home sits on the market for too long, people start to wonder what’s wrong with it. **The average days on market in our area is 28 days.**

If you price your home at or below market value, then you are in the best position to get as many eyeballs on your property and get as many offers as you can. That way, you can get the best sale price for your home.
