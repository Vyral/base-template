Today I'll be updating you on our real estate market here in Savannah in order to better serve you. To start, I'll just briefly touch on 2013, where we saw prices stabilize and interest rates remain low to push buyers forward into the market.

#### What 2014 has Brought Us...

1. Market activity has nearly doubled since this time last year.
1. Interest rates are still very low, which aids both buyers and sellers.
1. Home prices will continue to rise, which sellers will like to see. But buyers will probably like this too, as they will know that the home they have purchased will appreciate in value.
1. Low interest will keep buyers excited about purchasing, and this in turn will help sellers to close their properties faster as interest rates are expected to rise as we head into 2015.

#### New Office on Wilmington Island

I am also proud to announce that we will be opening a new office on Wilmington Island that will be affiliated with Keller Williams. We will be located on Johnny Mercer Boulevard in Mercer Plaza. Feel free to drop by and say hello sometime. We are very excited about our new location and would love to help you with real estate in that area.
