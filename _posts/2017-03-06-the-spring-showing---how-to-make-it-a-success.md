<div>Spring is upon us, even if the weather in the McLean area doesn&rsquo;t quite show it. That means many people will be placing their homes on the market. If you fall into this category, there are some steps you can take to ensure the quickest sale at the best price for your home. We can also suggest ways in which to keep from inadvertently sabotaging the sale of your home.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It probably is no news to you that, as with just about everything, the first place people look for a home, is on the internet. That means, you have to have something to place there which will grab their attention. The staging and photographing of your home is crucial in attracting buyers. However attractive your home is &ldquo;in person&rdquo;, if it isn&rsquo;t eye-catching online, buyers won&rsquo;t come.</div>

<div><img alt="" src="/uploads/versions/gresh-blog-3-20---x----300-205x---.jpg" width="300" height="205" /></div>

<div>Naturally, you will want to consult a good real estate agent. However, that agent can only sell the product that you present. This means that before you place your home on the market, you will want to have it sale ready. The few extra days it takes to prepare your home for sale can mean the difference between selling it in a timely manner for the price you want, and having it languish on the market, forcing you to lower the price.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>One of the most cost effective ways to brighten up a house is a fresh paint job. Another way to make things look &ldquo;finished&rdquo; is to replace worn or drab light fixtures, outlet plates and such. Then, of course, the ticket is to make it clean and neat for showings. That can mean a lot of work, especially if kids and pets are involved, but it is well worth the effort.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>When you photograph your home, be sure the area is pristine, and staged so as to leave no doubt about which part of the home is being viewed. Keep personal items out of sight. You want potential buyers to picture their belongings in your space. Before you photograph the bedrooms, make the beds with inviting linens, comforters, and plump pillows. Be sure the fixtures and appliances in the kitchen and bathrooms sparkle.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Take the necessary time to prepare your home for sale&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;placing it on the market. That is the best sales strategy.</strong></div>
