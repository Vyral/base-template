*As a property owner, complications can arise for you if one of your tenants can’t pay rent. As a property management company, we have a system in place to alleviate this concern.*

Sometimes, life happens and there’s nothing you can do about it.

 As a property owner, your goal is to pick the best possible tenant by making sure that they have a great credit score, a good background check, minimal criminal history, and great references. **Even if you pick the most qualified tenant for your property, though, things can go wrong.**

 For example, let’s say your tenant is in the military and they either get injured, have a medical discharge, or get divorced. That would mean a likely income change. If one of the spouses moved out of that house, things would also likely change dramatically. Whether that means trying to find another tenant or working with the tenant you already have, problems can arise that can complicate the rent situation.

 This is where we come in. We’re a property management company. The thing that we do better than anybody else is finding qualified tenants for your home. How do we do this?

**We have a break lease agreement with the tenant that states they are responsible for the lease as long as the property goes vacant.** As soon as we find another tenant, the Landlord-Tenant Code specifically states that we cannot charge rent to two different tenants for the same days. That’s against the law!

 In the event that one of your tenants can’t pay rent, we would quickly replace them to alleviate any negative rents or mortgages that you have to pay. We would get you your rent payments by the 7th of each month in your account, while collecting rent payments on the 1st. That’s our guarantee.

 If you have any further questions about property management, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Just give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to help in any way we can. Aloha!
