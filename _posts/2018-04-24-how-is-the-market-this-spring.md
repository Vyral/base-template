Spring is heating up in Boise and so is the current housing market.

With a huge shortage of homes on the market, it is definitely a seller’s market. Less availability drives up the value of homes, making it an excellent time to sell.

Buyers also have an advantage in this market. **Interests rates are super low** still if you are thinking about buying a new home. Interest rates are creeping up, however. So, if you are one of the people saying you will wait until the market settles with lower prices, I am here to tell you not to.

I don’t see prices coming down anytime soon and interest rates are slowly creeping up. It has been forecasted that interest rates may rise a full percent over the next 12 months. **This raise, could increase your house payment by two or three hundred dollars.**

If you have any additional questions as to why you should sell your current home, or buy a new one, please contact me. I would love to talk to you.
