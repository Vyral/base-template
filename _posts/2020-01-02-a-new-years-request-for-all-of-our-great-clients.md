<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Referrals are the lifeblood of our business, and we want to serve even more of them in 2020. Here’s how we plan on doing that.</em></p>

First off, I wanted to say happy New Year and I hope your 2020 gets off to a great start.

As you can see in the video above, I’m wearing my curly wig once again. Why? Because in need your attention. **In 2020, we have a goal to serve 125 referrals**. I’m so serious about this goal that I’m also wearing my 80s hair band wig.&nbsp;

If you have friends, family, or coworkers who are looking to buy or sell a home this year, **we would love the opportunity to be able to serve them at a high level and make their transaction as smooth as possible.&nbsp;**

Once we reach that 125 referral market, I’ll even consider wearing a MIckey Mouse headset, which you can get a peek of at the end of the video above. So let’s make 2020 an awesome year.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us or any referrals that we can help out with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to talking to you soon.
