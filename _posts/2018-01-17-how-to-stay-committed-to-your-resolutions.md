Today I’m going to talk to you a little bit about how you can stay committed to your New Year’s resolutions and how I can help you with them.

Have you had problems achieving your goals in the past? Do you make resolutions every year only to forget about them come February? I’ve been there.

My goal last year was to get back into shape and I’m proud to say that I’ve lost about 30 lbs since last year. I have a lot more energy because of it. How did I do it? I followed these four steps consistently:

**1. Create a goal that is super important to you.**It should be something you can obsess about. Think of it this way: This should be a goal that would make your entire year if you were to accomplish it.

**2. Track your actions.** Create a daily log of your activities. For my weight loss, I started logging every workout, every meal, and every snack. I used MyFitnessPal to help me keep track of things. I can’t stress enough that tracking is something you need to do every day in order to be successful.

**3. Focus on the pain points of failing.** For me, it was the thought of not being able to fit into my expensive, fitted clothes or underperforming while playing sports. Bringing up these negative emotions has a way of helping you stay consistent with your goals.

**4. Share your goals with somebody.** This is very important to do because there are lots of people out there who are hypocritical about themselves. Sharing with a supportive friend or family member will be really good for you.

You can always share your goals with me, too. In fact, I want to know what they are. If they are health or business related goals, I can definitely help you out. **I network with professionals in those fields weekly and my goal this year is to have coffee with 10 different people each week.**

If you’d like to grab a cup of joe with me sometime and talk, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
