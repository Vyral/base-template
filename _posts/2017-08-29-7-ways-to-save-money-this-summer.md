I just wanted to stop by quickly today and offer you a few tips to help you save on your energy bills this summer. Sometimes all it takes is a little fix to bring that bill way down. Here are seven things for you to consider:

**1. Plug and fill any holes.** Seal those window or door gaps with caulk or foam. If you have an external A/C unit, make sure that’s sealed tight as well. Fewer leaks will allow your HVAC system to run a lot more efficiently.

**2. Close your shades.** Sunlight heats your home when it doesn’t need to be, especially while you’re gone during the day.

**3. Make sure your air filters are cleaned every 30 days.** This will ensure that your air flow isn’t restricted in any way.

<br>**4. Program your thermostat.** Getting a smart or programmable thermostat can save you a ton. Whenever you aren’t home, you can keep the home at more energy-efficient temps.

**5. Unplug unused appliances.** They still use energy even if you aren’t technically using them. Turn them off to save a bit of coin.

**6. Switch out old light bulbs for new, energy-efficient ones.** They don’t use as much energy or put off as much heat.

**7. Look at the Energy Star ratings of your new appliances before you buy them.** This can save you a lot of money over time.

These are just a few of our tips for lowering those bills and making the summer a bit more affordable for you. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
