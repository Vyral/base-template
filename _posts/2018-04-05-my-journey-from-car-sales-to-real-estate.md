Today, we’re going to discuss my journey from car sales to real estate.

When I graduated from George Mason University, I needed a job. At the time, I had a friend in car sales that encouraged me to get into the business. I was definitely hesitant at first, but after I found out how much money I could make, I happily took the interview. The very next day I interviewed, and by the end of the week, I was selling cars!

There are many things I learned during my experience as a car salesman, one if which is a dedicated work ethic. If you’re in sales, you already know that you need to dedicate yourself to the customer. This means long days and long nights, no matter what the weather outside may look like. I also learned to swallow my pride. After earning a four-year degree, there’s a bit of a stigma selling used cars. I used the opportunity to work out my self-confidence.

I was in car sales for two years and did really well. After speaking with my accountant and my father, I decided to buy a house. The next time my dad came up to visit, we went to a couple of open houses, where I connected with a Realtor. Long story short, she stood me up. As you can imagine, I wasn’t very happy. In fact, I took it as a sign to not buy property at all. The very next customer I had at the car dealership was another real estate agent, and that’s when I knew it was time to buy my first home.

Two months later, I was buying a house and taking real estate classes. I knew that if I had issues buying a home, that there were other people in my situation too. That’s when I made the decision to get into real estate.

It’s been 17 years since I’ve entered real estate, but there are a few things from my time as a car salesman that I will never forget:

**Your friends will travel with you.** There are so many people that I’ve sold both cars and houses to, and there are many people I still have wonderful relationships with.

**Your database is extremely important.** There are so many people in your life who will follow you into the next steps of your career.

**Work ethic is important.** When you’re selling someone a car, you really need to understand what they need. That lesson also goes for real estate. You can’t sell someone what you think is best for them, but what is actually best for them in the long run. Sometimes those conversations are easy, and sometimes they are difficult.

That’s my journey from car sales to real estate. If you have any other questions or are interested in furthering your real estate career, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
