Today I'm talking about the real estate market and lumber prices. Lumber prices have been rising dramatically across the country. In the central Ohio area, **prices are rising monthly and sometimes twice a month.**

I have a current client that just bought a brand-new home. That home is now worth $40,000 more than it was when they purchased it. Now is a great time to buy a home because appreciation is going to continue and you can lock in a lower rate and a lower price.

We can assist you with your new home purchase. We have relationships with several builders, and **we can get you in the door and get you locked in at that price.** If you'd like more information, I can be reached at 614-267-2223. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day.
