The term “iBuyer” has been all the rage lately, and we’ve already done a few videos on this topic (which you can watch here and here). I’m proud to announce that we at Ursula & Associates now have a program called Keller Offers that gives the same benefits as other iBuyer programs.&nbsp;

How do iBuyers differ from the “I buy homes for cash” investors of yesteryear?

**One of the primary differences has to do with how technology is applied to the process.** The word iBuyer stands for “internet buyer,” and these programs use algorithms to determine what that they can offer for a property. However, there are a lot of caveats to this that most consumers aren’t aware of, and when you enter into an agreement with an iBuyer, you may be agreeing to things you may not understand.&nbsp;

In other words, the offer isn’t always the offer. By that I mean it’s subject to inspections. This is not much different than when we representing a buyer in a normal home purchase—we make an offer that’s subject inspections. If during the inspection, we find out the heating system doesn’t work, we’ll either want a discount on the price or request for the system to be replaced. The advantage of iBuyer programs, though, is that they do these kinds of repairs themselves and subtract the cost from the offer amount.

Keller Offers is similar to others in that it guarantees you don’t have to do any showings, we’ll make a cash offer, and you don’t need to make any repairs. The main thing that sets it apart is, though, is that **we don’t represent the iBuyer—we represent you.** If you sell to another iBuyer, there’s no counsel involved, so you might not be aware of any hidden fees.&nbsp;

Not only do we represent you, but this representation doesn’t cost a thing. The iBuyer will pay a reduced commission fee to us, but that has no impact on you. You get all the benefits of a normal iBuyer offer along with our counsel that explains each fee in detail, and these fees aren’t any different than what you’d find with other iBuyers. We’ll help you get the transaction done, and offer our representation for your next purchase, which, again, doesn’t cost you a thing.&nbsp;

Keller Offers is exceptional because, **unlike other iBuyers that rely on algorithms, we actually know the market and know what’s in your best interest.** Not every iBuyer offer represents your best interest, but we create real representation.&nbsp;
