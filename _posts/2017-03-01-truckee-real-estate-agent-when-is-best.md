<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">When is the best time to sell your house in the Truckee-Tahoe area? There are a few factors to consider: 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**1. What percentage of homes are selling on a monthly basis?** In March and April of last year, over 18% of homes on the market actually went into escrow. In August, 20% of homes went into escrow. That number dropped to 18% in September but jumped back up to 22% in November. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In short, March, April, August, and November had the highest percentages of homes in escrow last year. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">That number can shift depending on your neighborhood. For example, last March in Tahoe Donner, 75% of homes on the market went into escrow. Inventory is incredibly low in Tahoe Donner, which is why the percentage of home sales is so high. So far this year, inventory remains low. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Last April, Tahoe Donner had 58% of homes on the market enter escrow. That number dropped to 11% in May because more people put their homes on the market. As a result, you can expect inventory in Tahoe Donner to go up again this May. The percentage of homes sold went back up in November of 2016. 

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Overall, keep in mind that spring and fall have a higher percentage of homes go into escrow. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**2. What is the average selling price?** Between January and May, the average sales price in our area was $808,000; from August through December, the average price dropped to $776,000. <span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Prices go up when homes sell in the spring and drop a bit through the second half of the year.

<div style="color: #3d3d3d; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 30px 0 10px; text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Prices go up when homes sell in the spring and drop a bit through the second half of the year.<span style="color: #363d80; display: block; float: right; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In Tahoe Donner, the average price from January through May was $603,000. From August through December, the average sales price dropped to $575,000. Even luxury markets like Old Greenwood experience a similar trend, with an average sales price of $1.88 million in the spring and $1.6 million in the fall. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**3.
