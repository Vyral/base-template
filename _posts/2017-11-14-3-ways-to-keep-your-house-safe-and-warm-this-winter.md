As the weather gets colder and the days get shorter, we wanted to make sure you were aware of a few things you should be doing in your home before it starts getting too cold. **We were recently joined by our friend, Eric Kaiser of High Altitude Heating and Air, to give you three steps to keep your house safe and warm this winter**. Let’s get to the list!

**1. Have your thermostat checked**. During your regularly scheduled service maintenance appointment, I would also have the technician check your batteries and make sure that everything is working properly.

**2. Don’t forget to check your filter**. It’s the life breath of your HVAC system. It should be changed every few months.

**3. Reach out to a professional like Eric**. We always encourage you to reach out to a professional like Eric, who can help you with all of this. He will be able to check your furnace for safety, proper operation, and do a carbon monoxide check as well.
