Receiving your property tax notice in the mail can often lead to mixed feelings. While it's a good sign of owning valuable property, it also means the government expects their share. Fortunately, there's a way to potentially reduce the burden by appealing your property tax assessment. We'll walk you through the process of challenging your property value to ultimately lower your tax payments.

If you've received a property tax notice and believe your property's assessed value is too high, there's a process you can follow to contest it. Even if your mortgage company covers your property taxes, appealing the assessment can still be beneficial in the long run:&nbsp;

**1\. Review your notice.** Open your property tax notice and ensure all the information listed is accurate. Mistakes can happen, so it's essential to verify the details before proceeding.

**2\. Explore your options.** You have three main avenues for appealing your property tax assessment. These options usually include demonstrating that your property's value is inaccurate or that it's significantly higher than similar properties in your area.
