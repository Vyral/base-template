A lot of people have been asking me recently, “What’s up with buyer agency agreement? What does that even mean?”
<br>
<br>When you call the number on a ‘For Sale’ sign inquiring about the home that’s for sale, you end up talking to the listing agent that the seller has hired. That person has a legal obligation to sell that person’s home for the most amount of money in the least amount of time.
<br>
<br>Is that the person you want to work with? The person who has a direct responsibility to the seller to fulfill those obligations? I don’t think so.
<br>
<br>That’s why the state came up with buyer representation. In the words of a good friend of mine, “It’s the best money you haven’t spent.” It doesn’t cost you anything to work with a buyer’s agent, so why wouldn’t you?
<br>
<br>**There are many benefits to working with a buyer’s agent, such as:**

* We make sure you don’t overpay for a home.
* We shop interest rates for you to make sure you have the best financing available.
* We negotiate the best deal for you.
* We find the best home inspector to make sure the home doesn’t have any problems. If it does, we have the seller fix them for you.

**Furthermore, there are other guarantees packaged into our team’s buyer agency agreement.** For example, you can cancel our agreement at any time. Most Realtors want to lock you into a late fee contract, but not us. We want to hold ourselves accountable to you because we know for a fact that as long as you’re happy, you’ll have no reason to work with anybody else.

<br>
<br>Even if you walk into a home and immediately fall in love with it, we’ll give you reasons why you shouldn’t buy it. We don’t want you to make a bad decision, which alludes to our second guarantee: if you buy a home and you’re dissatisfied with it for whatever reason within the first 24 months, I’ll come over and sell it for free. Lastly, if we can’t negotiate a home warranty into the contract for you, then we’ll buy the house for you.
<br>
<br>If you have any more questions about the legal obligations and requirements of the buyer’s agency agreement, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be more than happy to help you.
