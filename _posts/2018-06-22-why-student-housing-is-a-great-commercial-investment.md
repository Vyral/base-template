Today I will talk about **why student housing should be part of your commercial real estate multi-family business.** I will also give you an idea where to search for these kinds of properties in Columbus

There are a ton of sub-markets within the multi-family commercial property market that you can focus on, but today we’re turning our eye to student housing. The Ohio State University is one of the largest public universities in the country, and a majority of those students live in just two ZIP codes: 43201 and 43202. These areas are close to downtown with the university just north of them.

With that being said, what are the benefits of investing in these kinds of properties? **For starters, student housing is essentially a recession-proof asset.** The majority of my family went to Ohio State during the time when the market was tough, and needed housing. Unlike other universities, the majority of OSU rental agreements are for 12 months. The rental market here is strong enough to support that.

Also, students need cosigners. For example, I lived in a 14-person house my senior year that we rented for $7,000 a month and each of our parents had to co-sign the lease. **Thus, the default rate on a lease like this is very low and makes this a very safe investment.**

Another benefit of investing in student housing properties is the ability to maximize rents. If you’re buying a 3-bedroom condo in Columbus, you’re probably renting it for around $1,300 a month. However, if you have a property close to campus, you’ll be able to increase the rents. One of the common value-added strategies we see investors in this space use is converting dining rooms, kitchens, and attics to extra bedrooms, which equals more rent and a better return down the road.

**Overall, student housing should definitely be part of your commercial real estate business plan.** A lot of our investors love investing in this kind of property in this area. There are some things you’ll have to deal with including the high turnover rate each year, but the enrollment of the university isn’t slowing down any time soon so you won’t have to look hard to find new tenants.

If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to commercial real estate in Columbus, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
