The moving and real estate industries have a lot in common. I recently spoke with Julie Woolslayer about some tips and tricks of the moving process.

I was recently joined by Julie Woolslayer of Great Day Moving, who you may remember from past conversations we’ve had.

She and her husband have a great business that I’ve used personally and also that I’ve referred to multiple clients.

The moving industry is very much related to the business of real estate, so I wanted to give Julie the chance to present some tips and tricks for moving.

First of all, Julie recommends that you should always start early in the process. If you think you’re moving, decluttering will help you for a number of reasons. Not only does it prepare a home for showing but it also makes it easier on you when it comes time to move your belongings.

Get as much help as you can from friends and family members when you undertake the task of organizing and decluttering your home. **One tip that Julie recommended on the matter was to read the book “It’s All Too Much” by Peter Walsh.** It’s full of great tips on how to organize and get rid of items in your home.

You may even want to enlist the help of professional organizers. The bottom line is that there is a lot of help available—you just need to get motivated and get started.

This process is especially helpful for sellers who are downsizing. Julie and her team are more than happy to talk to people undergoing the downsizing process in order to assess what kind of help will be most useful to them. She also mentioned Settled In—a company she’s worked with in the past that helps clients decide what to take and what to leave in a move.

Julie also has a plan for people who are unable to move into their new home right away but need to move their items out of their old home.

In situations like these, Great Day Moving partners with another Tulsa business: Premier Logistics. **Premier Logistics has trucks and trailers available for rent, which Great Day Moving then loads and stores at their 24-hour secured lot** for as long as the seller might need.

Then, once it is time to move, Great Day Moving brings the truck on site to the new home and unloads it as they would during any other moving process.

Overall, Julie works hard to offer moving solutions. In fact, if you call and tell our scheduler Kelsey that you saw this video, you can save $75 off on any move over two hours.

If you’d like to reach out to Julie you can contact her by calling (918) 877-1971 or by visiting GreatDayMoving.com.

If I can answer any other questions or you’d like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, soon.
