Today, I’d like to share two tips on how to correctly price your listing. These tips will help you maximize your earnings while also making sure your property doesn’t sit on the market too long.

**1. Look at your home from the eyes of a buyer.**The buyer is the one writing the offer on your home, so you need to consider how they are going to think about value. They will consider the features and benefits of your home compared to the features and benefits of other similar homes on the market. Everything, from the neighborhood to your home’s amenities, will be taken into mind when they look at your price. If other, similar homes have a more competitive price, buyers might not find as much value in your listing. This is why when my team and I work with sellers, we look at all competing listings to help you determine the right price for your own listing.

**2. Price your home at the level you’re willing to take.** Don’t give your home a price you’re willing to negotiate from.Give your listing a price you would be happy to receive. Most buyers are used to paying full price for homes. The only time they won’t is if there are no other offers. It’s very important to strategically price your home so that you have more than one buyer competing for your listing.

As an additional note, make sure that your home shines before buyers come out for a showing. The right price can only take you so far in the success of your home sale. Your home must be clean and polished, as well.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
