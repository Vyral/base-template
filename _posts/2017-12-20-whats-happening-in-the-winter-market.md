As we get close to the holiday season, I wanted to thank everyone for watching my videos, for your referrals, and for your business.

**I really appreciate everyone out there who has made 2017 such a great year**for me and my team. I hope our services have made it a great year for you as well.

Today, we are going to have a winter real estate update. In the next couple of weeks, I’ll go over a year to year real estate wrap up to see how the 2017 market did compared to the 2016 market. Right now, let’s see how November 2017 compares to November 2016.

**Overall, our market is doing much better than it was at this time last year.** Inventory is down right now. Last year, there were 469 single-family homes for sale, and this November, there were 382.

Sales are also up from 107 sales in November 2016 to 126 home sales this November.

We are definitely seeing inventory drop and sales are on the rise, which can only improve our prices.

Another interesting fact to keep in mind is that we only have a four-month supply of homes on the market. This is the lowest supply we’ve had all year. **Since demand is still quite high, it’s a great time to sell.**

**If you have a house that’s in great condition and a g**reat area, buyers are really waiting for a home like yours to come on the market.

If you have any other questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
