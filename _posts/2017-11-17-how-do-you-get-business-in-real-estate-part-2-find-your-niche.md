Today, I’d like to talk about how you can find your area of expertise. As an agent, it’s much easier to sell what you know and what you like.

When you show a house that you like, you’ll end up wanting to show it to every client you can. This is a great thing. So, **find a niche within real estate that you’re excited about and want to show off.**

Having this kind of passion will greatly boost your success. Whether what you like to work with is a particular kind of property or a particular sort of client, find what you excel at and stick with it.

So many agents don’t make money in real estate because they only scratch the surface of their potential. They end up spreading themselves too thinly over many different directions, without ever going too deep into any focused area.

**When you find something that you love, really dive deep into that as a pillar for your business.** If you eventually exhaust this area of focus, simply move to the next one.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
