I recently had a client who decided to stop making credit card and car payments, which really messed up the deal. That’s why I wanted to bring you some tips about how to protect your credit while you’re in the process of getting a mortgage.

If you’re planning on applying for a mortgage, you really need to start keeping a close eye on your credit for the five to six months prior. **Give yourself ample time to see what’s on there and pay down any debt or make any credit repair you need to.** We’re well-versed in the topic.

When you’re actually in the process of getting a mortgage, you definitely don’t want to apply for a new credit card or buy a new car. It can completely blow your deal. You don’t want to take on any extra debt during this time, even on existing credit cards.

**For any credit cards you do have, you want to keep the balances under 30% of the utilization rate.** If your limit is $1,000, that means keep the balance under $300. Not doing so can really mess up your debt-to-income ratio, which is crucial to your eligibility.

Basically, make sure that when you’re applying for a mortgage you don’t use your credit, and you pay it down instead. If you have any questions for us or have anything else you want to know about getting a mortgage, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
