<center><em>Here&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t wait until spring to sell your home.</em></center>

&nbsp;

**Did you know that January and February are great times to list your home?**

The busyness of the holidays is over when the new year begins and potential buyers are beginning to look at homes again. Inventory is still low as well, giving you less competition and allowing your home to stand out more. Spring is when everyone who’s been waiting to sell jumps into the market, **making it an incredibly competitive situation**.

If you’re looking to sell your home, have any questions, or would like some more information, reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
