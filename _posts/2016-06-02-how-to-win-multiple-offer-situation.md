In a seller’s market like the one we’re seeing in Roseville, multiple offer situations have become the norm. If you’re thinking of buying soon, don’t fret! We have got some great tips to share with you that will help you compete and win a bidding war.

1. A fully-underwritten desktop approval. Most agents just recommend a pre-approval, but we like to take it one step further. This will shorten the amount of time we need to close escrow, and will give you a better shot at competing with cash buyers. Generally, cash purchases come in and it’s a very short close, so this gives you a fighting chance to appeal to the seller in that way as well.

2. Negotiate before the offer is written. Before we even write an offer, we like to call the listing agent to see what is important to their sellers. It’s not always about the best price, sometimes the seller needs to be able to rent the home back for a period of time, or they want more earnest money. Whatever the case may be, we want to find out what will make your offer stand out above the others.

In addition to these, we have plenty more strategies that we use in these types of situations. Things like guaranteeing to beat the highest offer or guaranteeing the appraisal. We would love to go deeper into these tactics with you, just give us a call or send us an email and we’d be glad to help!
