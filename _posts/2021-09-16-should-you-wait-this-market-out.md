Recently, a lot of clients have asked me, “Should I wait for a market crash before I buy?” Today I want to answer that question and give you an overview of where our market currently is .&nbsp;

Let’s take a look at an average Chicago condo to figure out what you should do. The median price for a two-bedroom, two-bath condo is currently $420,000, and interest rates are around 3.5%. If the market were to crash, we could expect a 10% drop in price, leaving that condo at $378,000.

So you should wait for a crash and save $42,000, right? Not exactly. If the market is bad, **it’s very likely that interest rates will go up to compensate.** Even a rise from 3.5% to 4.5% would mean you’re paying more on your monthly mortgage for the $378,000 home than the $420,000 one.&nbsp;

The moral of the story is this: Interest rates have a much higher impact on your buying power than prices do. None of us want to overpay, **but we also can’t predict when and how a crash will happen.** You could sit around waiting for prices to drop only to have interest rates sneak up on you and lower your buying power.&nbsp;

Appreciation has also been very consistent in recent years. Even when there’s a correction, the market adjusts, and homes continue to appreciate at a steady pace. If no market crash ends up coming, you could find yourself looking at more expensive homes and higher interest rates.&nbsp;
