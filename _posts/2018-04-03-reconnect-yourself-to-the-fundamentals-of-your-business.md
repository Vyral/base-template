Several years ago, I walked into a CrossFit gym for the first time.

I had a background in competitive bodybuilding, and I had heard all about CrossFit, so I wanted to go check it out. My first day, **I saw a guy who was about 40 pounds lighter than I was snatching a significant amount of weight more than what I could possibly do at the time.** Snatching, in the Olympics, is when you pull the weight from the ground all the way overhead and catch it in a full overhead squat. It really bothered me that this kid was so much smaller than me and made it look so effortless.

After watching several times, I finally put my finger on what it was that made him able to do this—it was his shoes. The pair he wore were the exact same pair as they wore in the Olympics. I later went on to Amazon and found and bought the same pair of shoes. I returned to the gym with a new level of confidence; I was going to show this kid up, since I was so much bigger than he was.

Do you think I was able to crush him, now that I had on the exact same shoes?

**Absolutely not.**

Yes, the shoes do have value, but here’s the trick: I didn’t have the skillset that I needed to be able to do the lift in the first place. **This can serve as a message for today’s real estate market.**

In today’s market, there are more shiny tools and distractions than ever before. Every single day, there’s someone walking into your office offering you a new tool or strategy. So many people are jumping from one strategy to the next, thinking that this one will be one. Someone else succeed with it, so why shouldn’t they?

It was the same thing with the Olympic snatches; I learned that the shoes were just a piece of the tool. My mobility was nowhere near what it should’ve been. I didn’t understand the techniques of the movement or how to break down the mechanics of every single piece of the lift.

It really came down to the question, **“What are the fundamentals for success?”** What are the fundamentals of the lift that I need to learn in order for me to be able to increase my ability to snatch?

There are a couple things that are important to think about:

**1. Reconnect with the basics.** Break things down into their simplest form—too many of us are looking for the new, shiny way to do things when, realistically, success comes down to mastering the fundamentals. There is a place for adding creativity to our world, but only on top of the proven models and basics of our business.

**2. Consistently commit to your tasks.** It’s not that we can decide to go lead generate for a day or two and then be done with it because we conquered it—we have to commit to the same core activities. There are parts of our jobs that we absolutely love to do, but there are a lot of things inside our world that just aren’t as fun. We have to commit to the monotony of success.

**3. Connect with a coach.** In order to reconnect with the fundamentals of the snatch lift, I knew that I needed to contact a coach. My coach was not only able to show me the movement but also taught me how to do it as well, showing me where I needed to improve.

The goal in today’s market, the most competitive market we’ve ever seen in the real estate industry, is for agents to recommit to the fundamentals. Take a step back and ask yourselves what you’re doing well and which areas you need to increase your skill set in.

**Commit yourself to the monotony of success** while knowing what the flow of your day looks like, and the better you will get at the monotonous part of your business. You’ll have more time and energy to put into the things that you love doing in your career.

If you’d like the opportunity to connect with the fundamentals, **I currently have a webinar series called “Real Estate: The Fundamentals.”** It’s free and is held every Monday morning from 8 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. You can join in at any time, and if you’d like to go back and visit topics we’ve discussed previously, visit us at [**www.savvyagent.biz/fundamental**](http://www.savvyagent.biz/fundamental).
