It’s that time of year where the market is getting busier and busier, and we seem to be coming across a lot of buyers who only want to work with a listing agent when buying a home.&nbsp;

Why? Because it’s commonly believed in the real estate world that you can save money on commission fees by only working with a listing agent.&nbsp;

**Here’s the thing, though—you can’t.** When a seller lists a house with an agent, their listing agreement extends to just the two of them, meaning the listing agent has a fiduciary responsibility to uphold the seller’s best interests, not the buyers.&nbsp;

If you decide to work directly with a listing agent when buying a home, that makes you their customer, not their client. They won’t have your best interests in mind. In fact, it wouldn’t even be legal for them to have your best interests in mind\!

That’s why **you should always hire your own agent to represent you when buying a home.** It won’t cost you any more, and it will potentially save you thousands by preventing you from making any missteps when writing the purchase agreement.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the importance of buyer agency or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
