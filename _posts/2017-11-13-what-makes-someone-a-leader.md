What does it mean to be a great leader?

To help me answer this question, I’m joined by a special guest: Kadi Cole. Kadi wrote an amazing book called “Sticky Note Leadership” that deals with this subject exactly.

According to Kadi, all of us are leaders in our own way. The John Maxwell quote “Leadership is influence” really applies here.

**If you have influence over the team you work with, the business you run, your kids, or anything else, you are a leader.** Kadi says it’s also important to remember that we all have 100% influence over ourselves. So, self-leadership acts as a great foundation for becoming a strong leader, in general.

Simply getting up in the morning and following through with your goals are good first steps toward self-leadership. When you can be a strong influence on yourself, you can be a positive influence for others.

This is an idea that comes into play in the realm of parenting, as well. And **parenting and leading a business have a lot in common**. The goal of any parent is to raise a self-sufficient and independent adult. This is the same goal leaders have for their businesses.

It may take a lot of hands-on leadership to achieve your goals for your business, especially when directing new employees, but **your influence will ultimately lead the members of your team to be able to self-manage.**

If you haven’t read Kadi’s book, I really recommend doing so.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
