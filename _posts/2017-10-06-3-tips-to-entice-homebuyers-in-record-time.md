Today I’m joined by Brooks Sommer, who has been a working with us since 2012. He has worked in just about every role on the team. He’s been a listing manager, closing manager, and buyer’s agent.&nbsp;

Now, Brooks is a great listing agent, and he has three tips that he wanted to share with sellers to help you entice buyers in record time:&nbsp;

**1. Get some high lumen light bulbs.** You can order them on Amazon. These light bulbs add a lot of light to your room, which is great. You want your home to be light, bright, and open when it comes time to sell.&nbsp;

**2. Add a fresh coat of paint to the interior and exterior.** Fresh paint conveys the idea that the home has been maintained well and doesn’t need a lot of work.&nbsp;

**3. Maximize your curb appeal.** Make sure your house pops in online pictures and when people pull up in your driveway. Maximize your curb appeal by trimming bushes and the grass. You can also add some color with flowers and mulch.&nbsp;

If you are going to put money into your house to prepare it for the market, we want to make sure you get that money back when it comes time to sell. These three tips will help you draw more buyers to your home without breaking the bank.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about selling your home, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
