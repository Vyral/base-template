If you are thinking of selling your home, think sustainability.&nbsp;

A new survey by the National Association of Realtors just came out, and it made some remarkable points. For example, 61% of Realtors said clients are interested in sustainability. Also, a whopping 71% of Realtors said energy efficiency is valuable in helping sell a home.

So, if you are interested in sustainability and you want to sell your home for a higher price, here are three projects to consider:

**1\.******E**nergy-efficient appliances.** Energy Star-certified appliances such as fridges, washing machines, and clothes dryers can be as much as 40% more water efficient and 25% more energy efficient than standard models. Those numbers go way up if you compare new energy-efficient appliances with models that are more than a few years old.&nbsp;

Other gadgets throughout your house might also warrant an update. For example, if you have an old thermostat or an inefficient water heater, then smart new alternatives such as the Nest thermostat or solar water heaters might also be worth a look.

**2\. Solar panels.** Speaking of solar, homes with solar panels sell 20% faster, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Even more impressive, they sell for a whopping 17% more than comparable homes without solar. And with a range of state and federal incentives still in place, solar can be a great way to make your home more green and attractive at the same time.&nbsp;

**3\. Windows, doors, and siding.** Renovated windows, doors, and siding typically recoup about 80% of their cost in terms of higher home value. However, a full suite of energy-efficient windows, doors, and siding might be worth even more in the current sustainability-minded market. Plus, these projects increase your home’s curb appeal, making it more likely your home will get more interest from potential buyers.&nbsp;

Any of these projects can potentially add a lot of value to your home. If you want to discuss which sustainability projects might make the most sense in your particular case or what kind of sale price you could achieve, please feel free to give me a call.
