I take training seriously in my career. Here’s a look at some of the best training I received this year.

I’m here today to answer the question, “What’s the best sales training I learned this year?”&nbsp;

I can honestly say that we’ve trained more this year than in any of the 16 years I’ve been in business, but **I think the one topic that has helped us serve our customers on a deeper level is how to isolate objections.** This is a really good way to approach customer service and let people know what their next step is.

What does isolating an objection look like? Well, first it starts out with a written or oral consumer notice. Next, when I’m having a conversation with someone, I invite them to the office or offer to come out to their home. They might offer up an objection, such as they’re waiting until spring. To follow up, I would learn more about their process by asking what is so important about the spring to them. **This is where I might find out the real objection.** Maybe someone they trust told them to wait because they’ll get the best home.

The next step is isolating that objection. Other than finding the perfect home in the spring, is there anything else that would prevent them from taking the next step in the home buying process now? **If they say no, now I can stand side by side with the customer and talk to them about that singular issue.** I then pose the hypothetical: If the perfect home were available now, will they want to take the next step sooner? If they say yes, we let them know that we don’t know if the perfect home is out there or not until we look. Then I invite them into the office to see if we can find the perfect home. If they don’t find anything, we can just wait until spring.

I wouldn’t have gotten to that point without isolating the objection and solving it with them. It’s a process, and I skipped this part for 16 years. You can bet I won’t anymore. This has been a huge help for me, my team, and our clients. If this information was helpful for you or you want to talk about anything else related to building a successful real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
