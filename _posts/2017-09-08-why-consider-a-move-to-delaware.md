The coastal communities in Delaware have experienced unprecedented growth over the past few years. The reasons why are plain to see.

If you and your spouse are nearing retirement or are empty nesters looking to downsize, coming here to the Delaware coast is a great option. &nbsp;Delaware has some of the lowest real estate taxes in the country. **There’s no sales tax here, either. This is one of the primary reasons that retirees look for homes here.**
