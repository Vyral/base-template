{% include youtube.html %}I recently made the switch to Palmer House Properties and wanted to briefly discuss why.
<br>
<br>Palmer House Properties is new to St. Louis, but we have more than 1,500 agents in four states and we're one of the fastest-growing real estate companies in the nation. **They let agents be entrepreneurs and set their own commissions; it's truly your business.**We're a transaction fee-based brokerage, so you really are the boss.
<br>Â {% include pullquote.html %}
<br>There are plenty of perks, too, like free signs and free supra boxes, as well as free errors and omissions insurance for the first year. After the first year, it's just $45 annually.
<br>
<br>If you want to learn more about this opportunity, we'd love to meet with you to talk about switching to Palmer House Properties and everything we have to offer. We hope to hear from you soon!
