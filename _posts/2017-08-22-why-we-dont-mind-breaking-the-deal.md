When you work with the AskSarita Team as your buyer’s agent, we work with you and we’re on your side.

**This means we protect you and your interests.** If we were looking at a house, we would look at everything through the lens of your needs and interests.

If we were looking at a home on a Sunday afternoon on a busy street, it would be a bit quiet. Whereas you might fall in love with the home’s big kitchen or master closet, I would tell you to look at the busy street and the fact that it’s 3 p.m. on a Sunday and advise you to visit that house tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. to make sure the street’s not too busy.

If you were to tell me that you love that house and want to write an offer on it, I might remind you that it has power lines in the back or the interior has no dining area.

That latter example is actually based on a true story. I was checking out a beautifully staged house once with some clients who were absolutely in love with it. However, the dining room was located on the opposite side of the house from the kitchen. When I pointed this out, our clients looked at us like we were ruining their party.

That’s what our team is about—we don’t mind breaking the deal. We will find you the right house, whether that means the one we’re currently looking at or the next one. In fact, when we’re under contract during the inspection period, you get to keep looking for houses.

**We break the deal because we’ve got your back.**

If you have any questions for us or are thinking of buying or selling a home in our Portland market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
