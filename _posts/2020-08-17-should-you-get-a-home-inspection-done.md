Here’s why you should get a home inspection done when buying a house.

Should you order a home inspection?&nbsp;

I would highly recommend a home inspection to anyone who’s buying a house. It’s one of the biggest purchases you’ll make in your life, so **it’s imperative to know the exact condition of the property.** It may look great, but there could be significant issues you can’t see.

It’s always best to have a third party do a thorough walk-through and look at the roof, furnace, mechanicals, windows, foundation, plumbing, etc. The inspector will give you a detailed written report about the home’s condition.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about home inspections or real estate in general, I can be reached via phone or email. I would love to speak with you about whatever you need.
