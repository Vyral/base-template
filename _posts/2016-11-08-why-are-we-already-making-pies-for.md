In the midst of an incredible season in Denver, I wanted to reach out to all of you. As Thanksgiving approaches, we wanted to let you know how much we appreciate you, from our friends and family to all of our past, present, and future clients.

 The rest of our team is hard at work right now in the kitchen making Thanksgiving pies for you all. We will be giving out pies once again this year to show our thanks. We’ll have pumpkin and apple this year, so make sure that you get one!

Keep an eye out in the mail for our postcard, which has all the details about your pie on it. If you haven’t received one yet, or would like to, give us a call or send us an email and we will send one out. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
