If you want to sell your house and buy a new one at the same time, the first step should be meeting with a Realtor to come up with a strategic plan that's all based on your timeline.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>We always want you in a position of leverage.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**We'll first address your house to figure out how to position it on the market to maximize traffic**. Then, we'll set you up with a professional lender to discuss how much you'll make when selling and your financing options for the next home.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>With a very competitive market like we're seeing in Carroll County, you must differentiate yourself as a buyer. This means getting your finances totally lined up with a lender and having them go through a full pre-approval process. This will prevent financing from holding you up when you want to make an offer.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>The next step is one of the biggest, and that's **getting your property on the market and positioned well**. To do this properly, your Realtor needs to do extensive research on both sales of similar homes in the last three to six months and your competition on the market. You'll also have a home staging consultation at this time. You want to be in constant communication with your Realtor to make sure you stay within your desired timeline. Then, we'll have your home professionally photographed and get it officially on the market.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It all starts with that consultation with your Realtor where you figure out how to position yourself both as a buyer and as a seller. If you have any questions or you're ready to begin the process of selling your home and buying a new one, give us a call or send us an email soon. We're here to help.
