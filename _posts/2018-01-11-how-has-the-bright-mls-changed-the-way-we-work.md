How has the Bright MLS changed the way my team works?

First, I’d like to clarify that Bright isn’t paying me to write this blog. I just wanted to share some information about the Bright system that my team and I have learned over the past few months.

I’ll be the first to admit that when the Bright change first took place, there were a lot of kinks in the system. A lot of our properties didn’t show up on consumer sites, and some didn’t show up on my own website. Searching was also difficult; results didn’t come up the way they should have, especially in the first week or two.

Although a lot of organizations stick their heads in the sand when they go through changes, **I was impressed by how responsive Bright’s staff was.** Whenever we needed assistance or there was a technical issue, they would tell us where it was in the queue and when they expected the issue to be worked out.

They also held private trainings at our office, and we went to Harrisburg for additional trainings. There were five or six trainings as a whole.

Bright even sends daily updates about technical difficulties or where problems were in the queue. Bright was incredibly responsive, and most of the kinks have been worked out at this point.

Now that I’ve had time to learn the system and get feedback from my agents and staff, I’ve been able to see that this system has a real positive impact, and I’m extremely grateful for that. **Here are a few important things that Bright has been able to do:**

1. I am able to get data in areas that I wasn’t able to before. I remember often feeling stupid because a customer was able to go on Realtor.com and give me property information that I had to struggle to find in the system. Now, I can just jump on Bright and get information on a market that’s 45 minutes away. I can even get more information than the customer can, which allows me to offer them some value.

2. I don’t have to pay for and learn a mode-able system. Since Bright is a large, regional system, I can look in the same system, pay the same dues, and save all that time and energy that I would have spent learning a new system.

3. There are many useful tips and tricks that have made us more efficient and saved us a huge amount of time. For example, the web mapping search allows us to look at flood zones, public record information, and more. **I’ve been incredibly impressed with the owner information available for properties that aren’t listed,** including the assessed value. There are many tips and tricks this system offers that Paragon didn’t.

I am incredibly grateful to Bright and their staff for the dedication they put into the transition. I think the Bright MLS will improve my life, my team’s lives, and my client’s lives.

I would love to hear any feedback or tips that you’ve discovered that impact your business. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
