For today’s installment of Coffee and Conversations, we’re joined by special guest Lori Marks of Travel and Tours Unlimited.&nbsp;

Over the years, Lori has helped me plan a lot of awesome Disney vacations over the years, so I felt compelled to bring her on and let her explain a little more about what she does.&nbsp;

Lori has been in business for 20 years helping families make dreams come true. Having grown up with Disney herself, Lori says it’s something that is very special to her. **She actually visited Walt Disney World the very first year it was open.&nbsp;**

“We’re all really busy in our day-to-day lives, and vacations are something everyone looks forward to. [...] Making memories with the people you love is really important,” says Lori.

Speaking of families, Lori raised her own children right here in Carroll County. She says this community is very important to her, so she loves serving it with her business. And in the 20 years Lori has spent helping local families plan their Disney vacations, she has learned quite a few things most people might not know about the parks.&nbsp;

According to Lori, a lot more goes into planning these trips than most people think. She does recommend that families use itineraries, but also says **there are many secrets to be discovered throughout the parks if you take the time to really explore.** The Keys to the Kingdom tour, for example, is one hidden activity Lori highly recommends for park goers 16 and over.&nbsp;

Of course, your trip doesn’t have to be to Disney World. Lori helps people plan trips of all kinds. If you need help planning an upcoming trip, we highly recommend you work with Travel and Tours Unlimited.
