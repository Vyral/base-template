We want to invite you to a Charleston RiverDogs game at Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park as a way to say thank you, and we’re also raising money for charity. All of our friends, colleagues, and past and current clients are welcome. The game is on June 14th, and our free picnic will start at 6:00 p.m.

For every person that attends, we will donate $10 to the MUSC Children’s Fund in order to send children to Camp Can-Do, which is over on Seabrook Island.

Our goal is to donate at least $3,000, but we need your help to do so! We still have lots of tickets left, so just call the number on the screen and tell us how many tickets we should reserve.

There will be free food and drinks starting at 6:00 p.m., and the baseball game will start at 7:00 p.m.

Last but not least - it’s still a great time to sell a home in Charleston. We’re still in a seller’s market, but when rates rise it may be more difficult to sell a home. If you list now you can cash out and then buy a home when the market is in your favor.

Buyers should also be aware that it’s a great time to purchase with interest rates still so low. However, they may see a small rate hike in June that could affect affordability. If you’re thinking of buying, get in touch with us now before your affordability takes a hit and you’re knocked out of your ideal price bracket.

If you have any questions about this event or about our local real estate market, please don’t hesitate to contact me!
