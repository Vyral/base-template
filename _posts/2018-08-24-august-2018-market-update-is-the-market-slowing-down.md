I’m often asked about how the real estate market has been doing, so I’ll today I’ll provide you with an update about the trends we’ve noticed lately, as well as a few predictions about where the market is headed.

**We’ve seen over the past three months that the market is slowing down a little bit.** One reason is the president’s recent tax changes, which caused interest rates to up this year. As rates go up, affordability drops.

Homes are taking a little longer to sell; the average days on market is about 45 to 50 days in the Frisco area. However, in retrospect, the prices for sellers have stayed fairly flat, along with the number of sales we’ve had this year compared to last.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, here’s some advice for you: Remember that your home will take longer to sell, so your agent will have to work hard to sufficiently market the property to as many buyers as they can. You’ll also need to price your home correctly or risk losing buyers and having to do price reductions. **Be patient and reasonable, and you should do just fine.**

Buyers in our market can now afford to negotiate and be a little more selective; at the moment, there isn’t as much concern about having to compete with multiple other buyers. We’re even seeing sellers taking contingencies, which was never the case in the last three or four years. **It’s a great time to be a buyer.**

Now, what do we expect the market to do in the future?

My prediction is that we’ll see pricing stay flat. Interest rates may dip down just a little bit to help speed up the economy from a housing perspective, but not too much. We’ll also likely continue to see longer sales process. Buyers will find themselves with more to choose from and more room to negotiate.

It’s also important to note that traditionally, **November and December have been some of my best months for business.** That’s because people who move and sell during those months are extra motivated to complete their transactions so they can settle into their new home or job if they’re relocating.

If you have any questions from me regarding real estate or you have a topic you’d like me to address for you, I would be glad to help. Feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss your situation and make a plan.
