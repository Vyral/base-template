Are you thinking about buying or selling a home soon? If so, you should probably get an inspection; yes, even the sellers. Today I want to talk about why inspections are important to both parties in a real estate transaction.&nbsp;

In my opinion, **every seller should get a pre-inspection before they list.** This way, you can address any issues before you go on the market. This will ensure your transaction runs smoothly and your buyer doesn’t walk away.&nbsp;

For buyers, the benefits of an inspection are a little more obvious. Often, your seller will be willing to help pay for any items on your inspection report. The cost of those repairs almost always exceeds the cost of the inspection. **Don’t be scared of the inspection report.** Properties deteriorate over time, and a report is just a tool you can use to make the best purchase you can.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this topic or anything else real estate-related, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!
