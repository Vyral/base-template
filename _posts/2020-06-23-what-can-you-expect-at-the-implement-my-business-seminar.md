<center><em>It&rsquo;s time to learn how to put our systems into action!</em></center>

<br>Thank you to all the amazing real estate agents who joined me in June to learn how to “Mirror My Business\!” I provided you with lots of systems, tools, and tips on how to build a big business, with much of it coming from your database. Today I’m excited to share with you a follow-up series and a deeper dive to teach you how to “Implement My Business,” launching in July\!

**For six weeks starting on July 7, we’ll hold 90-minute sessions in which we’ll discuss accountability and connect with like-minded agents who look forward to building a big business**. I’ll even throw in a extra systems and tools that I couldn’t fit into the “Mirror My Business” workshop.
