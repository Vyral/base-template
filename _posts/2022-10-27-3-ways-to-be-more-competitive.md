Do you know the components of a good offer? This information is the difference between being a window-shopper and actually wanting to buy a house. You must know what will make a good offer if you want to win your dream home. Here are three things you can do to create a good offer:&nbsp;

**1\. Make sure you and your agent understand the market.** Being educated on the norms of the current day is essential. Many people like the “low-ball approach” where they start their offer low with the expectation of needing to go up. However, certain markets don’t allow for that. Plus, it takes quite a bit of money to make a difference in the monthly bill.

**2\. Know the sellers.** Find out what the sellers want out of the deal. There are some contingencies and rent-backs happening in today’s market, so know if that would sweeten your offer. Have an agent on your side who can find out that information for you. We call this “the art of the deal”, and we are very trained to help you with this.&nbsp;

**3\. Be flexible.** Have a good purchase price, be reasonable with closing costs as well as timelines with closing and inspections, etc. Again, working with the seller will help you create a win-win scenario.&nbsp;

Know that our team is very knowledgeable on this subject and would love to help you put out a great offer. If you have any questions or are interested in our services, call or email us anytime\! We look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
