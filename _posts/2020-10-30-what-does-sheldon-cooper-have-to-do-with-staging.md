<br>What does Dr. Sheldon Cooper from “The Big Bang Theory” have to do with curb appeal and staging?

People purchase homes based on emotion, then rationalize with logic afterward. Therefore, you should **make the walk-through a positive emotional experience for buyers**. You want buyers to feel something when they see your house and when walking through it. Start with curb appeal: For example, make sure your lawn is well manicured before showings.

As people walk into a home, they make their buying decision within seconds, then confirm it while walking through the rest of the house. Thus the entryway is crucial; it needs to look its best. You’ve heard the cliche that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, well, it’s the same with staging. **Flowers are an easy way to provoke emotions**; they’re a symbol of life, so people simply feel better with flowers around them. Dates, anniversaries, and funerals often include flowers for this reason.

Earlier I asked what Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to do with curb appeal and staging. To see him, go to 2:15 in the video above. We like to place this Sheldon cutout in different areas of homes. He surprises, scares, and makes people laugh—they have an emotional reaction.

When people are surprised, endorphins are released, and they feel differently; that’s what you want when they’re in your house. **Like our Sheldon prop, you want your property to stand out and be memorable**. (Why Sheldon? His character is pretty memorable, too.)

If you have any questions or would like to learn more strategies for staging your home, give me a call, drop an email, or send a carrier pigeon. I’d love to help you realize your real estate dreams.
