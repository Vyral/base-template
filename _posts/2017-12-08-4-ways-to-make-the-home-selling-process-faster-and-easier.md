If you plan on selling your home, follow these four tips to make the whole process quicker and easier.

**1. Take photos of your home early.** Don’t wait until the grass turns yellow and the leaves are off the trees. Prepare in advance by taking pictures of the inside and outside of your home while the landscaping still looks really good and green.

**2. Have floor mats ready.** It’s wintertime in California, which means the weather will be rainy. Have floor mats going in and out of your home so that people don’t track water onto your wood or laminate flooring. The last thing you want is for buyers to come in and leave a mess all over your home.

**3. Make sure everything is working properly.** You don’t want a buyer to come to your home and find that two out of three lights aren’t working. Make sure the HVAC system works as well. Buyers always test everything to make sure it works.

**4. Listen to your Realtor when it comes to home pricing.** You don’t want your home to be on the market longer than it should. Pricing too high will cause your home to linger on the market, which causes buyers to wonder what’s wrong with it. Make sure that you work with your Realtor to make sure that your home is priced correctly for the market.
