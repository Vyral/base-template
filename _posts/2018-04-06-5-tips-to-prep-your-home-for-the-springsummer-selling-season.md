If you want to get your home ready to sell quickly and for top dollar in our spring and summer selling season, there are five tips you need to follow.

First, when you’re dealing with buyers, remember that **your home’s first impression is sometimes its only impression.**

Second, don’t over-upgrade. If you’re going to put your money anywhere, make sure it’s an upgrade that will give you a good return on your investment. I recommend sticking to two areas: your kitchen and your bathrooms.

Third, conceal your critters. We love our fur babies, but not everybody else does, and they could impact buyers when they walk through your home. Consider factors like allergies or certain buyers being fearful of animals when showing your home.

Fourth, price your home right. This is very important—price is what sells homes.

**Last but not least, hire me and I’ll handle the rest for you.**
