While on my way to a listing appointment, I thought it would be a good idea to show you how the Wolek Group prepares, with a look at our listing bag.&nbsp;

**Whenever we have a listing appointment and it’s time for us to go, we pick up a "swag bag" which includes a lot of goodies inside.**

The first thing in there is a black folder that contains our tiered service level agreement, comparables from the neighborhood, and tax records. Then, we have our listing presentation manual in there to show them how we’ll market their home. **This all stays with the client.**

There’s another black folder that contains things that need to go back to our office, such as our “Pass the baton” form, our VIP Questionnaire, and a paper listing agreement. There’s also an addressed envelope in there for us to send them a thank-you note after the appointment.

**Some other fun things in the bag include a branded water bottle, a branded sticky note pad, a pen, and branded packing tape and a sharpie.**

Let me know the fun things that you guys do for your clients and the different ways you get ready to win your listing appointments. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
