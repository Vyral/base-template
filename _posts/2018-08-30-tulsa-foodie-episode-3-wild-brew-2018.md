On today’s episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” I’m at Wild Brew 2018 to sample some great artisan beers and food selections from both the local area and abroad.&nbsp;

There are more than 50 breweries and 50 restaurants at this fun event, and if you follow along in the video above, you can hang out with me as I make the rounds and chat with several restaurateurs and brewers.&nbsp;
