Waiving contingencies has become a controversial topic in real estate lately. Today I’ll discuss why many buyers are waiving contingencies in this competitive market.

In the Oregon sales agreement document, many contingencies are baked into the text. For example, the disclosure contingency allows you to back out of a deal due to disclosures. The inspection contingency allows you to terminate the contract if the property needs repairs that aren’t negotiated to your satisfaction. The financial contingency makes the purchase dependent on your being fully approved for the loan and also accounts for the appraisal; if those things don’t pan out, you can back out of the deal and get your earnest money back.

Not to speak ill of Oregon, but in terms of contingencies, our market isn’t as sophisticated as some others like California. There, they have a set process where sellers pre-inspect their homes before listing the property and then go into their offer-review period.

Unfortunately, sellers in Oregon don’t often pre-inspect their properties, and they might only take a couple of days to decide which offer to accept. Since most buyers can only put so much money down and offer a specific amount, **many are waiving all sorts of contingencies to make their offers stand out.** For your protection, we typically don’t recommend that you waive contingencies.

To be clear, my job isn’t to tell you what to do when you’re writing an offer; instead, it’s to give you the full menu of options for how to strengthen your offer. As the buyer, you will ultimately decide which options to order from the menu, and **how strong you want to make your offer depends on how much that home means to you.**

Every week, our team helps buyers write offers and sellers accept offers, so we’re up to date on the best-known methods to win a multiple-offer situation. If you want to know what it takes to win in this market and would like to discuss the pros and cons of waiving contingencies, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to guide you through your options so that you can successfully purchase your next home.
