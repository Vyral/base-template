Today I have invited a full service, real estate attorney, Susan Pesner with Pesner Kawamoto Law Firm, to speak with you about the difference between a settlement company with a lawyer available and a settlement company without a lawyer available.

Overall, it is always a better option to hire a settlement company with at least a lawyer available or a law firm like Susan's with settlement options. The main advantage with a law firm is that they can provide you with personal legal counsel and can interpret many different contracts for you. Many other companies have lawyers on staff while others simply outsource as needed but will remain neutral should a legal dispute arise. At the Gresh Group, we highly recommended those companies with at least 1 full time, employed lawyer on staff that we can connect directly with should an issue arise. (delete - Susan's office will work to make your settlement much easier and less painful, and they will fill you in on what is happening throughout the entire process.)

Susan has been handling settlements and settling real estate disputes for over 35 years. Her goal is to give you a smooth transition from purchase to sale. Susan's office is just 10 minutes away from ours, and she is always able to help buyer and sellers in Northern Virginia.

If you would like to know more about Susan or how she might be able to help you, then please feel free to contact her at 703-506-9440 or SPesner@PesnerKawamoto.com.

As always, contact me at 703-636-3588 or Janet@TheGreshGroup.com with any questions or concerns about real estate in Northern Virginia.
