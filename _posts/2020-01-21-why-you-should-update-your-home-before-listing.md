*Should you invest the time and money necessary to make your home move-in ready before you sell? Here’s what I think.*

If you have a home to sell and it needs updates, is it better to do the updates before you hit the market or should you offer some kind of allowance or discount to buyers instead?

Here’s my opinion. **When you’re selling a house that needs updates, it’s always better to make those updates before you hit the market.** For starters, it gives buyers that move-in ready feel.

{% include pullquote.html %} Another thing to think about is a lot of buyers don’t have the creativity to look past the changes that need to be made to a home. It takes a special person to want to take that work on. It’s the same reason that builders don’t leave spec homes unfinished.&nbsp;

**When you do make renovations or improvements, it's important to choose styles and features that appeal to the highest number of buyers.** If you don’t have the money to put into these renovations, we offer a special program for sellers who are in the same position. We can help you do the work, bring your home’s value up, and get a nice return for an investment that you really aren’t even making in the first place.&nbsp;

Ultimately, this is how you will get top dollar for your home. If you have questions about this program or about anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
