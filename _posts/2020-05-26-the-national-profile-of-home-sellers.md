The National Association of Realtors has released their annual report of Home Buyers and Home Sellers.&nbsp; This is our second segment, if you missed the Home Buyer report, please visit [www.SternTeam.org](http://www.sternteam.org), there’s a lot of valuable insight.&nbsp; Today we’re going to cover the NAR’s 2019 profile of home sellers.

• Remember that the typical home buyer was 47 years old?&nbsp; 2 decades older than when I first started my real estate career.&nbsp; Well the typical home seller was 57 years old? Now I’m starting to get a clearer picture of why our inventory levels have been so low.&nbsp; When I first started selling real estate a homeowner would live on average between 3-5 years in their home and then move.&nbsp; I think the Great Recession of 2008-2011 really changed the dynamics of real estate.&nbsp; People are living in their homes much longer, about 10 years on average according to the NAR.&nbsp; Obviously this is a national number, as you’ll find in metropolitan areas along the Wasatch Front they move more often.&nbsp; But still, this means we’ve had much less inventory over the past decade for buyers to choose from. &nbsp;That fact coupled with sellers holding off to sell their homes because of COVID 19 has really put a damper on the availability of homes for sale.&nbsp; It actually means that if you need to sell, do it now.&nbsp; You’re in the driver’s seat\!

• Just like buyers, 89% of sellers worked with a real estate agent or broker to sell their home.&nbsp; About 6% sold to someone they already know.&nbsp; That’s smart as it may seem easy to sell a home, but in reality there are over 180 tasks to navigate to get a home successfully sold.&nbsp; To avoid the headache, contact a real estate professional\!

• For recently sold homes, the final sales price was a median of 99% of the final listing price.&nbsp; This doesn’t necessarily track price adjustments made on listings that were over priced for the market.&nbsp; This is just the median list to sale price of the FINAL list price of a home.&nbsp;

• 75% of sellers contacted only one agent for the job of selling their home.&nbsp; 66% found that agent through a referral from a friend, neighbor, coworker or relative.&nbsp; This is also true for our business.&nbsp; The majority of our business comes through referrals, which we appreciate.&nbsp; Referrals are the lifeblood of our business through the past 2 decades.&nbsp;

• 44% of all sellers traded up into a larger home

• The median equity cashed out during the sale for future investment into another home was $60,000.&nbsp; That’s a lot of bucks\!&nbsp; We talked about the networth of a homeowner being 45 times that of a renter, and here is just one example of that fact.&nbsp;

• The distance between a home sold and a new home purchase was 20 miles.&nbsp; People usually move to improve school districts, house size, garage size and yard.&nbsp;

• The average home owner lived in the home they sold for 10 years.&nbsp;

Well that’s a lot of numbers to digest, and that’s officially a wrap.&nbsp; In real estate it pays to hire a professional who knows their market.&nbsp; It’s great to have a look at national numbers, but a true real estate professional is a local economist.&nbsp; They’ll know the local trends to help you capitalize on the sale price and speed of sale for your home.&nbsp;
