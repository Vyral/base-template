I’ve had a few clients call me in the last few months to let me know about someone they know who is locked into a contract and very unhappy. This has happened with both buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

**I strongly advise you against signing a long-term listing agreement or buyer’s representation agreement of any kind.** You should be able to have an easy out of your contract if you feel your agent isn’t doing their job. That’s the way we see it. You certainly wouldn’t marry someone who was a new acquaintance. While it’s not for life, a long-term listing agreement can really leave you in a bad spot.

Long-term listing agreements set you up for failure. Most of the time, once an agent gets you to sign one of these agreements their subsequent commitment to you will be minimal.

We do things differently around here. If any of our clients aren’t happy with our service at any time, all they have to do is let us know and we’ll release their listing within 24 hours. **We will continue to work as hard on the last day of the agreement as we do on the first day and every day in between.**&nbsp;

Your home is likely one of the largest investments you’ll ever make. You owe it to yourself and your family to protect it. Before you enter a long-term listing agreement, give us a call or send us an email so we can let you know how we can help.

If you have any questions or need any assistance in the meantime, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
