<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your current market conditions for Bigfork and the surrounding lakeside communities are ready for you.</em></p>

I recently sat down and looked at the current market conditions around Bigfork during a Facebook Live event. Our mid-year waterfront market report revealed some interesting things that I wanted to share with those of you that may have missed it.

Since I deal with so many areas, **I have timestamped the different places so that you can know more about the market you are most interested.&nbsp;**
