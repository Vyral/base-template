For a limited time only, we’re allowing you to use the Keller Personality Assessment to find out what your strengths are and how to leverage them.

Have you ever taken a behavioral assessment before?

We have many agents who want to build teams and leverage behavioral assessments in their screening process to determine whether the people they’re hiring will be a fit. The most common of these behavioral assessments is one called the DiSC profile, and the big mistake a lot of people make is going to Tony Robbins’ free website and using the free DiSC profile offered there.

The problem is, that particular behavioral assessment is geared towards a person who is in their personal and home life, so the results you get from it can vary wildly from something you’d get from a paid Abelson DiSC that costs anywhere from $10 to $20 per report.

Dr. Abelson has a great DiSC report that’s entirely based on a person’s job world, and it provides much more clarity for the hiring process. Beyond that, we see people also use things like activity vector assessments from corporate consulting that cost $250 each.

At Keller Williams, **we’ve built our own proprietary tool that our agents have access to called the Keller Personality Assessment.** This is the only one that actually gauges not only what a person’s natural behavioral style is, but it also talks a little bit about their cognitive abilities by checking things like IQ and how quickly they pick up on new things.

We’re very excited to be able to offer this to our agents. For a limited time only, **you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjuq4vQJFnROQL-B_rYI1xzK1RynFPP0IUM0hs6A1R90aidQ/viewform" target="_blank">click here</a> and submit the form and we will send you a link where you can complete the KPA.** We’ll then sit down with you and talk about what your strengths are and how you can leverage them to be a great real estate agent.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help.
