In order to get top dollar in today’s marketplace, there are a few simple steps you can take.

**One of the first and best ways to obtain top dollar is by hiring and working with a top-producing agent.** Working with a quality real estate agent who specializes in the market in which you are selling is key.

You need to hire an agent with a proven track record and a reputation for success. To be sure of this, interview the agent. Watch and listen carefully to see what kind of sales skills they apply during the conversation.

These same skills are the ones they’ll bring to the table when they help sell your home. Powerful negotiation skills are a great indicator that they will do a great job.

However, selling your home for top dollar will take more than simply a great agent. Your stylist and agent may make suggestions during the process on how to improve your home. If either of them suggest repairs or aesthetic changes, be open to doing them.

Some common improvements that are done to homes before they’re sold include making them depersonalized and also maximizing their space. Buyers will want an open, neutral slate when they view your home.

Sanitizing, cleaning, and modernizing the home will also make a difference.

Although you are striving for top dollar, **you need to be realistic about what that number can be.** Your agent will provide you with a comparative market analysis, which will show you the correct price range in which to list your home.

Another tip is to make sure that your agent approaches the transaction with a very specific and proactive mindset. One of the first things they should do is market your home online using professional photographs. Next, the right client will have the skills and knowledge to undertake a massive networking campaign to promote your home.

This campaign begins with your agent getting into contact with other top agents, relocation companies, their own database, and anyone else within their sphere of influence in order to find the right buyer for your home.

With a market that changes daily, this step is imperative to making your home visible and to getting it sold.

A good agent will also be honest with you when providing feedback. A top agent will relay information from the buyers to you exactly as it was originally stated. Not only that, they will also be able to provide you with solutions to any given objections or obstacles that appear. **You should always be receptive to your agent’s feedback.**
