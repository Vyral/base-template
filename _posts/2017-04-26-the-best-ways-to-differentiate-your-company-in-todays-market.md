What really differentiates companies in today’s marketplace? The two biggest ways companies can set themselves apart are through **thought leadership and online presence.&nbsp;**

Now, 2017 is going to be a big year for manufacturers in the building products industry. As a whole, the industry is projected to grow, but that also means there will be a lot of competition. The manufacturers who stay ahead of the curve with their sales and marketing efforts will continue to create competitive advantages as the industry continues to rebound.&nbsp;

In many ways, though, the building and design industry is still old school. Jobs are won and lost through relationships and connections, and products are chosen for similar reasons. Even though manufacturers understand that their online presence is important, they haven’t gone the extra step to truly differentiate themselves from the competition. The “follow the leader” mentality is still a prevailing force in the industry, and even the companies who invest in their online presence tend to have similar online profiles.&nbsp;

**As online usage continues to grow, your online presence needs to measure up.&nbsp;**Consumers want the manufacturers to solve their problems, so manufacturers are realizing that just pushing their product isn’t enough to get their audience’s attention anymore. You really have to produce thought leadership through articles, blogs, videos, and other online content that really helps solve that everyday business problem.&nbsp;

Ultimately, great marketing helps the audience solve the issues that matter to them. Remember, people are not buying products; they are buying solutions.&nbsp;
