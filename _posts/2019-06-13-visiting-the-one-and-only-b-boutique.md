In today’s community spotlight, we’re visiting B Boutique in Catonsville to speak with co-owners Meghan and Sarah.&nbsp;

My wife absolutely loves this store, and **though it opened two years ago****, it’s as popular as ever.** Meghan and Sarah have been friends for over 20 years, and the story of how this establishment came together is an interesting one.

As it turns out, Megan was shopping for boutique items to sell in the salon she owned and noticed that she could buy tons of clothes to sell. When she saw that there was a need for a boutique in Catonsville, she asked Sarah to be her business partner.&nbsp;

Besides selling clothes, they also regularly host private shopping events and other parties. Additionally, you can find plenty of other great accessories and gift items in their store. In fact, they only stock two of each item so that not everyone in Catonsville is wearing the same thing.&nbsp;

**They’ve also opened a new location in Ellicott City,** which they’re very excited for because it gives them the opportunity to serve a whole different crowd and experiment with their vibe a little bit.&nbsp;
