Let’s jump right into the numbers, starting by comparing the stats from Scott County from December 2018 to December 2017.

For the price range at and under $250,000, the market was extremely hot in 2018; homes were flying off the market right and left, selling very quickly. Last year at this time, we had 48 active listings; this decreased in 2018 to 24 active listings. Considering that 2018 was such a low-inventory year, that’s a startling number—**we’re down almost 100% in inventory at that price point.**

The price range between $250,000 and $400,000 was also very hot in 2018 for move-up buyers and sellers. In 2017, this range saw 172 active listings, compared to 2018’s 126. That’s about a 15% decrease, signaling a lot of activity. Part of the reason that inventory is slightly higher in this price point is that there is a lot of new construction inventory. **Of the current 126 active listings, 58 of those are new construction, which is almost half the market.**

For the $400,000 to $600,000 range, which is also a popular price point in Scott County due to new construction, there were 147 active listings on the market in 2017. As of 2018, there are 152 active listings, constituting around a 5% increase. Here, 61% of the active listings are new construction.

In the price point above $600,000, there were 120 active listings in 2017, and 79 this year. That’s a 50% drop, and a third of that inventory is new construction.

 We continue to see contingent offers, and considering the season we’re in, we’ve actually seen a relatively busy end of December. We have been keeping an eye on the political climate; right now, **interest rates have held pretty steady, and we don’t expect any major changes to those at the beginning of 2019,** but one can never really know. I think it will be interesting to see what happens with inventory levels and the market in general as we head into the new year.
