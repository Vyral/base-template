Today, I'm going to give you a quick recap of the Savannah real estate market!

The market has been incredibly active over the last few months and we've kept very busy. In 2014, the market continued its steady growth and price levels continued to rise as well. Since the turn of the new year, the positive signs we were seeing have only accelerated!

As you know, real estate is all about supply and demand. Homes are flying off the shelf when they're priced well, staged well, and marketed well. As far as interest rates are concerned, most experts are predicting an increase in interest rates around May or June, which may have an affect on our market.

As it stands, we're heading into spring with our hands full. The market is active, and we're expecting it to get even busier as the year moves along!

If you have any questions about our market, or if you could use our help in any way, give us a call or shoot us an email at www.McIntoshRealtyTeam.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
