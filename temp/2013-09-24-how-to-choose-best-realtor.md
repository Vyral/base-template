How do you choose the best real estate agent when buying or selling a home? Itâ€™s very important to interview at least 3-4 different agents. You want to find an agent that has a personality you will mesh well with. You also want an agent with experience.

Some new agents have a lot to offer, but depending on your needs, choosing a realtor with years in the field can help make the process a lot easier for you.

Ask your family and friends who they would recommend. This way you have knowledge of their service and work ethic.

We have a 16-question survey we can send to you to help find the best realtor. Just call or send us an email!
