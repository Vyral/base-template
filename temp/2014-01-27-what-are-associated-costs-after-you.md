Welcome back. I wanted to thank you for watching our videos and submitting questions. We want to be your real estate resource and we appreciate your responses!

One question we were asked recently was about how much it costs to sell your home. Often we forget about the costs of selling. Here are a few things to keep in mind.

1. Commission - If you use an agent you are responsible for paying their commission.
1. Moving - Are you going to hire a professional mover?
1. Home warranties - While these are negotiable, often times buyers ask sellers to provide a home warranty on the property.
1. Closing - This is negotiable too, but depending on how the offer is structured, a buyer may ask the seller to contribute or pay all of the closing costs.

If you have any questions about the above costs or just about anything real estate, give me a call at 912.658.7255
