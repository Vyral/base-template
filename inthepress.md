THE WOODLANDS, Texas (KTRK) -- Priyanka Johri owns and operates the Pure Mutts Animal Sanctuary in The Woodlands area. 

Pure Mutts is on her one-acre property, where dogs who need special attention receive care. 

"I feel like this is my calling," Johri said. 

Her sanctuary is non-profit. Pure Mutts is funded through her real estate business, Woodlands Eco Realty, where 20 percent of her earnings go directly to care for sick dogs.
