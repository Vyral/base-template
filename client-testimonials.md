"We chose them because they were short sale specialists and that's what we wanted to do with our home. I thought they were fine. It took us two years to sell the home, but that had nothing to do with them because they had tons of walk-throughs. We had several offers, but the bank just took a really long time with processing [the transaction]. They did a great job. The house actually got broken into at one point. Some of the copper wiring's got pulled out. They had been keeping really good tabs on the house because we weren't living in it at the time. Dane, the Realtor, notified us immediately and helped me out with figuring out how to take care of it and negotiating with the bank. From that end, it was really helpful and took a big stress load off of us because had a bunch of other stuff going on at the time."

"I was really satisfied with them. We were able to buy a house and Ali our realtor was able to really get a good deal for us even after we got an appraisal that was less than what we offered. So she's a go getter. I think the whole thing was above and beyond especially when we pretty much thought that the sellers were going to back out because the appraisal came in less than we what we offered. She really continued to fight for us and get us the best deal. It was just awesome. She continued to work and I mean she could have just said oh well let's just go find another place, but she didn't. She continued to work for us."

"Atia, my real estate agent was amazing! She was very friendly and helpful, willing to accommodate me anytime. She made sure she came to my closing and even changed her schedule so she could make it. I will recommend more people to her!"
