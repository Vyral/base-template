Rob took a very hands on, personal approach.

I was able to have access to them at almost any time. Communication was very important. Another thing that made the process easy was a weekly report of what had been accomplished. I always knew exactly what the hold-up was, because of the weekly update. It even came in graphic form, which made it easy to read. Finally, Rob came to closing. I've had lenders with me at the closing before, but Rob was there to answer any questions from the buyer as well. This is totally rare, as not many lenders would be willing to take the time or make the effort. The title company was impressed, the buyer was impressed, and obviously I was impressed. Not only did he do this for me, but he does it for everyone. It's just impressive.</span><br />

<span style="color: #262626; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;">We have worked with Rob on several transactions, and it's been nothing but a positive experience. He always answers his phone and his team is very quick to respond to emails.</span><span style="color: #262626; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;He gets everything taken care of, and always closes on time. I would rate them ten out of ten. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
