<p class="testimonial-text">“I talked to my mortgage representative that was doing my loan and asked him if he had  any real estate agents that he could recommend who could help me and my sister look for a duplex and he gave me Sandy’s phone number. From the beginning she was really convenient with our hours and with communication. We work and we have a baby and sometimes we’re better by text, email, or our hours are crazy and she’s always able to get back to us. And if she doesn’t answer she texts you right away and lets you know ‘I will call you back.’ She’s really good with communication. There was a couple of times where because the property we bought was for me, my sister, and our husbands and if we didn’t understand something she would come to our house to get us all together and go over everything. Even if it was at 9 PM, 10 PM she was really convenient with our hours because it was really hard for all of us to get together and she made it work, even if it had to be at 10 at night. If you want to work with someone that’s personal, nice, convenient, and will go above and beyond to help you find your home she is the right person. She kept us very up to date with everything that was going on during the process of getting our house.”</p>
