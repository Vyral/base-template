"I was really satisfied with them. We were able to buy a house and Ali our realtor was able to really get a good deal for us even after we got an appraisal that was less than what we offered. So she's a go getter. I think the whole thing was above and beyond especially when we pretty much thought that the sellers were going to back out because the appraisal came in less than we what we offered. She really continued to fight for us and get us the best deal. It was just awesome. She continued to work and I mean she could have just said oh well let's just go find another place, but she didn't. She continued to work for us."

"Atia, my real estate agent was amazing! She was very friendly and helpful, willing to accommodate me anytime. She made sure she came to my closing and even changed her schedule so she could make it. I will recommend more people to her!"
