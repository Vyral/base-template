We feel very blessed to have had him as a real estate agent, and would strongly recommend him to any other potential buyers or sellers. We know that we absolutely plan on using his services again in the future. <br /><br /> Aaron worked really hard to find us the best house in this difficult market. Even after the sale, he really made sure that he was still involved in our lives. We could call and ask him about a question we had about the home, and he was always available. It wasn't just a commission for him. He really made the experience super personal and I feel as if we've created a long time friend, which I think goes a long way. We had an excellent experience with Christine &amp; Company and Aaron Hendon, and we thank you for all your help. Aaron- We promise we'll have you over for dinner soon!"<br /><br /></span></p>

I was confident the entire time of that my family was in good hands with Christine and Company. One thing that I really liked about working with Aaron was that as we were going through the process, he always shared all the possible moves we might make, and then gave me his recommendation and why he was recommending that move or option. I really appreciated having all that information. He was always prompt to return calls and answer any questions that I had. I just felt like I was taken great care of and we sold the house with minimal effort or complication, and I will continue to work with Christine and company because they take good care of you."<br /><br /></span></p>

I'm very pleased with everything that was done and the way it all turned out. My house was sold really quickly on the island. His availability was really important to me and I really appreciated it."<br /><br /></span></p>

Christine and the people that she worked with were there to guide us the entire time. Christine set us up with a mortgage company that she knew would come through as fast as possible, and she made herself available no matter the time or day. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and didn't expect it to go as smoothly as it did. It was a very stress-free situation, and I really enjoyed working with them.<br /><br /></span></p>

<h2>How Christine &amp; Company Helped Charles Make His Dreams Come True</h2>

<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291484021&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></span></p>

I had a limited <g class="gr_ gr_282 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="282" data-gr-id="282">first time</g> buyer budget and was in a market that was changing quickly with the economic crash in full gear.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f2f2f2;">She understood that I wanted to make my dollar stretch as much as possible now and into the future. Knowing this, a little 1912 foreclosed shack in Seattle came within reach of my budget. It was basically next to restaurants and the water- the perfect location. Even with many obstacles of having an FHA loan and working with the bank owner during the multiple require fixes, Christine navigated the process quickly and smoothly password.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f2f2f2;">Fast forward to just 7 years later. I messaged her to help sell that little Beach Shack. My goal was to find a modern, spacious, place with great views in a fantastic neighborhood. Knowing that my beach shack was meant to be developed, not lived in, Christine worked her magic and found a developer that offered my full asking price without even having to put my place on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f2f2f2;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f2f2f2;">The asking price was more than double what I paid, and it allowed me to purchase the home of my dreams, and it's a modern town home in the same neighborhood. I feel so lucky and thankful every day that I'm in the gorgeous new home, and I couldn't have done it without her. Christine and her team are truly amazing. They are like a tight that family that is more than happy to work hard and make your sale, <g class="gr_ gr_300 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="300" data-gr-id="300">search</g> and purchase an unforgettable, easy, smooth and fantastic experience.

I was a nervous wreck, but it didn't faze Christine &amp; Company. Both transactions closed on schedule. They are very professional, very thorough, and fun to work with.

About a year and a half ago, I got the chance to work with Aaron Hendon on purchasing my first house, and he was absolutely amazing. He made sure that we looked at everything I wanted to look at, and made sure that I asked the questions that I didn't even know I needed to ask. When I called them to look at the house I wanted to buy, he was right there and ready to go over everything the next day. He made sure we got everything set up to look at the house and then made sure that the inspection was ready to go through on the day we needed it to. Next time I buy a house, I'll definitely give him a call."</span></p>

I ended up listing my condo while I was out of town on a month-long road trip, and Christine convinced me to come in on a conservative price, and we ended up with nine offers in one week. She got me $42,000 over asking price, which I was thrilled about. When I got back to town, she took my best friend and I to Mt. Vernon, to show us a home outside of her typical service area. When it came time for the inspection on the home I wanted, she sent a team member out to be with us because the listing agent couldn&rsquo;t be there. Ultimately, she ended up closing on my place in ten days. This is the second time I&rsquo;ve worked with Christine, and she made it so easy. I give her many kudos, Christine is great.

We were, of course, first time home buyers and Aaron really walked us through the process. He was there to help us a through the different scenarios that come up during the appraisal and inspection.</p>

My husband and I were looking to buy a home in Seattle, which had a terrible market for buyers. Aaron really helped us look at this process in a positive light, steering us to look in areas that were realistic, where we actually had a shot. He championed us to make a bid that was a bit of a long shot. That also presented a learning opportunity.</p>

We were ready to throw in the towel, bidding on a house we weren&rsquo;t happy with. He encouraged us to keep looking, and because of that, we were able to find the perfect home. He also set us up with Britta, his coworker at Christine &amp; Company, who is a great, positive source of energy while looking at houses every Sunday morning. I&rsquo;m not much of a morning person, but she really helped us out."</p>

We really didn't realize that the sale of our home would happen so quickly before we even had a home to move into. Needless to say, we were worried we wouldn't be able to find <g class="gr_ gr_306 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="306" data-gr-id="306">our</g> forever home in time. I scoured the web and local groups in search of a home for a family of five. Aaron had reached out so kindly and generously and gave me some wonderful advice. He offered his help if we needed it. There was absolutely zero pressure- he was just really, really helpful. My husband and I spoke about it, and we both decided that we really wanted to use Christine &amp; Company in the search of our future home.</p>

We need someone to be able to view these homes for <g class="gr_ gr_302 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="302" data-gr-id="302">us,</g> while giving us the best options, and we definitely trusted him to get the job done. He viewed properties for us and reached out on behalf of us to see what was out there. Three days after we entered into escrow on the sale of our home, Aaron found the perfect time for our family, a day before it hit the market.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: Interstate, 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 100; line-height: 19.6px; background-color: #f2f2f2;">He went out to the home first thing the next morning and sent us a video tour of the home. This kind action really helped make a decision on a home, sight unseen. After watching this video, we knew this would be the home for our family.

My wife and I decided we wanted to move to Vashon pretty quickly after having met with Aaron previously, and found a house we fell immediately in love with. In the span of just a couple of days, we got Aaron up and running. After seeing the house, we put a bid in on it and squared away everything we could possibly have hoped to figure out. The best part about working with Aaron was that he always made sure we were making informed decisions, every step of the way. This happened before we even began looking at houses when we were just talking about which Realtor we wanted to work with. Aaron is passionate when it comes to home buyers educating themselves about the interview process while hiring a Realtor. As a homeowner, you are putting someone else in charge of the biggest purchase of their life. Not only that, but he has all the data to back it up, in terms of how he performs. We saw this when it came time to sell our home and buy a new one. Not only does Aaron go above and beyond in terms of providing the red carpet service that Christine &amp; Company is known for, but we also got a full team of people ready to handle every one of our concerns, questions, and conveniences when it came to selling our home. They also did everything they possibly could to make sure that we felt comfortable at every stage. Selling our home with a big deal for us, and Aaron took care of all those little concerns. He got our home to sell way above asking price with a very aggressive pricing strategy that we trusted him with, and it ended up working out great for everybody involved. I could not recommend, Aaron Hendon at Christine &amp; Company more. I never want to move again, but if I had to, I would absolutely call them back up to use their services.</span><br /><br /></span></p>

So we stopped searching for two weeks when Aaron called us and said, &ldquo;I found your house&rdquo;. We went to see the house and it was awesome. It was just above our budget and that was not including any bids from other people who were most likely going to drive the price way above what we could pay. He coached us on how to write a really good letter to the seller. We ended up getting the house at $19,000 below the asking price.

There were times when there was a house we were crazy about that seemed like it was in our price point and he would say, &ldquo;We can write up an offer on this if you'd like, but I'll tell you the truth, it's going to get multiple offers and go for the final asking way out of your price range,&rdquo; and he was right every time. We finally ended up finding the home we wanted and he was really savvy about reading the listing agent, seeing what kind of interest there was and what was necessary to put together the winning offer.&rdquo; -Mike</span></p>
