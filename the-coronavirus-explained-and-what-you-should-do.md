### **Kauai’s Local CSAs**

##### &nbsp;

##### Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has become a popular way for consumers to buy local, seasonal food directly from a farmer.<br>&nbsp;

##### How does it work: a farmer offers a certain number of “shares” to the public. Typically the share consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products may be included. Interested consumers purchase a share (aka a “membership” or a “subscription”) and in return receive a box (bag, basket) of seasonal produce each week throughout the farming season.<br>&nbsp;

##### [***Āina Hoʻokupu O Kīlauea’s (AHK’s***)](https://www.ainahookupuokilauea.org/farmersmarketbox){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;– This non-profit is the home of the Kilauea Community Agricultural Center located on Kilauea Rd.

### **Kupuna Kare of Farmer Fare**

##### <br>Malama Kauai and Hawaii Foodbank launched a program to help benefit our Kupuna (elderly) and farmers. The program distributes produce from our County Sunshine Market Farmers to distribute to our high risk Kapuna throughout the island, for approximately 8 weeks or more, with the help from our team at Elderly Affairs.<br>&nbsp;

##### To prevent the spread of disease, the program has been designed as drop off only with no interaction between deliverer and the recipient.<br>&nbsp;

##### If you’re 70 years or older on Kauai and would like to participate, please call 808-241-4470. If you’re a Sunshine Market farmer and would like to participate, please call 808-241-4299.<br>&nbsp;
