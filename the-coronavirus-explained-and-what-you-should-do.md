## FOOD -

[Try Eat Hawai’i](https://tryeathawaii.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;is Kauai’s newest online farmers’ market platform connecting farmers and consumers directly during this time. With an ability to arrange pick up or delivery, the developer, Matthew Oliver, provides a one-stop place to find your local farmers and their produce.&nbsp;

<p style="font-size:18px">Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has become a popular way for consumers to buy local, seasonal food directly from a farmer.

How does it work: a farmer offers a certain number of “shares” to the public. Typically the share consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products may be included. Interested consumers purchase a share (aka a “membership” or a “subscription”) and in return receive a box (bag, basket) of seasonal produce each week throughout the farming season.</p>
